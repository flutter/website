## Flutter Widget Inspector

The Flutter framework uses widgets as [the core building
block](https://flutter.io/widgets-intro/) for anything from controls (text,
buttons, toggles, etc.) to layout (centering, padding, rows, columns, etc.). The
Inspector is powerful tool for visualizing and exploring Flutter
these widget trees. It can be helpful when:

* Undestanding existing layouts
* Diagnosing layout issues

For a demonstration of the Inspector, please see the recent
[DartConf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIcmJNT9DNI).

## Get Started with the Inspector

The Inspector is currently available in [the Flutter plugin](/get-started/editor-setup/)
for Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA.
