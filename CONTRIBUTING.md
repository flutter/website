If you would like to contribute to the Flutter project,
we’re happy to have your help! Anyone can contribute, whether you’re new to
the project or you’ve been around a long time, and whether you self-identify
as a developer, an end user, or someone who just can’t stand seeing typos.

If you aren't familiar with how GitHub works, see [Introduction to
GitHub](https://services.github.com/on-demand/intro-to-github/).
We have many [repos in the Flutter project](https://github.com/flutter),
but two of the primary repos are the
[Flutter SDK](https://github.com/flutter/flutter), and this repo, the
[Flutter website](https://github.com/flutter/website).
To contribute a fix to a repo, submit a [pull request
(PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

For information on contributing code or API docs to the Flutter SDK, see
[Contributing to
Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
in the [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) repo.

We are also happy to accept your PRs to the
[Flutter documentation website](https://github.com/flutter/website/) repo,
even if it's just to fix a typo.
