- name: AbsorbPointer
  description: >-
    A widget that absorbs pointers during hit testing. When absorbing is true,
    this widget prevents its subtree from receiving pointer events by
    terminating hit testing at itself. It still consumes space during layout and
    paints its child as usual. It just prevents its children from being the
    target of located events, because it returns true from RenderBox.hitTest.
