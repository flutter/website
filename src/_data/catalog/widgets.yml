- name: AbsorbPointer
  description: >-
    A widget that absorbs pointers during hit testing. When absorbing is true,
    this widget prevents its subtree from receiving pointer events by
    terminating hit testing at itself. It still consumes space during layout and
    paints its child as usual. It just prevents its children from being the
    target of located events, because it returns true from RenderBox.hitTest.

  description: >-
    A widget that receives data when a Draggable widget is dropped. When a
    draggable is dragged on top of a drag target, the drag target is asked
    whether it will accept the data the draggable is carrying. If the user does
    drop the draggable on top of the drag target (and the drag target has
    indicated that it will accept the draggable's data), then the drag target is
    asked to accept the draggable's data.

  description: >-
    A widget that can be dragged from to a DragTarget. When a draggable widget
    recognizes the start of a drag gesture, it displays a feedback widget that
    tracks the user's finger across the screen. If the user lifts their finger
    while on top of a DragTarget, that target is given the opportunity to accept
    the data carried by the draggable.
