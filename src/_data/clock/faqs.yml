- title: What do I submit?
  content: >
    See the submission instructions in the ‘Getting Started’ section, and the
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybyQCK8Sy7vrD9wuc6pbgwVkyrVZ7Rd_41r5NXGqlt8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Official Rules</a> for more details.

- title: Can I submit more than one entry?
  content: >
    We limit entries to one per participant. We encourage you to submit your best entry! In the event of multiple
    submissions from a single participant, we'll only judge the most recent.

- title: I've already built a clock face; can I submit that for the challenge?
  content: >
    Unfortunately, no. Only new clock faces built after November 18th, 2019 can be submitted for consideration.

- title: Can I make fresh updates to an existing clock face built in the past, and submit that?
  content: >
    No, you must submit a new clock face started for this contest to qualify.

- title: Does the clock have to show the time?
  content: >
    The viewer should be able to tell the time. Whether that be with digits, clock hands, a sundial shadow, or colors
    flashing in Morse code, there should be some way for a user to reliably determine the time. (It’s OK if telling the
    time requires some thinking.)
- title: Do I need to add any extra functionality like alarms or stopwatches?
  content: >
    No, this will not be considered by the judges when determining winners.
- title: Does the clock have to use data retrieved from ClockModel?
  content: >
    No. We provide the ClockModel mockable API for system-level information on the Lenovo Smart Clock. This API is
    available to you in your clock face, but using it is not required.

- title: Must my clock have both a dark and light mode? Should I animate the transition between dark and light mode?
  content: >
    No, to both questions. The Lenovo Smart Clock has a feature that animates a clock between dark and light mode based
    on the room's brightness. You can use it to determine a dark and light theme, but it's not required. You can also
    animate between themes using, for example, an AnimatedBuilder or ValueListenableBuilder, but it's also not required.

- title: Does the clock have to show other information, such as weather and date?
  content: >
    No. We provide the ClockModel, a mockable API including weather information on the Lenovo Smart Clock. You don't
    have to display or use any of this information.

- title: How do I change the clock settings (e.g. weather, location, 24 hr time format)?
  content: >
    Tap the sample clock face to show/hide the settings cog in the top right corner, and then tap on the settings cog.

- title: What language(s) should the clock use?
  content: >
    Any. If you have words in your clock, consider
    <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> internationalizing
    them<a/>. Note that written parts of your submission must be in English to be eligible for judging, and your submission must, at a minimum,  support English language
    evaluation. However, we will not judge your clock face for language inclusion. Please ensure that your clock face’s
    text does not include profanity in any language, and is built and submitted in accordance with the
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybyQCK8Sy7vrD9wuc6pbgwVkyrVZ7Rd_41r5NXGqlt8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Official Rules</a>.

- title: What accessibility requirements should I add?
  content: >
    Google values accessibility, and it will be a consideration in your submission as part of the “overall execution”
    criteria. Check the <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Flutter accessibility</a> page for details.

- title: >
    Will the judgement of my clock have the same UX considerations as for the Lenovo Smart Clock? For example: Should I
    consider how the clock looks in a bedroom setting, or in a dimly lit room? Must I consider use cases such as the
    user waking up in the middle of the night, or viewing the clock from across the room?
  content: >
    No. See the judging criteria in the
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybyQCK8Sy7vrD9wuc6pbgwVkyrVZ7Rd_41r5NXGqlt8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Official Rules</a> for more details.

- title: What tips do you have to check the performance of my clock?
  content: >
    Take a look at <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/rendering/ui-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flutter performance profiling</a>,
    and enable the <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/rendering/ui-performance#the-performance-overlay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance
    overlay<a/> feature in the
    <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/devtools/inspector#debugging-layout-issues-visually" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flutter
    Inspector</a> to see whether frames are being drawn redundantly.

- title: Is there an age limit to participate?
  content: >
    You must not be a minor (per your country of residence) to be eligible for the contest.

- title: Can I use Flare animations?
  content: >
    Yes, you can use <a href="https://rive.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flare</a> animations in your submission.

- title: >
    Can I store data in a separate file? For example, can I store a list of ways to say 'Good Morning' in a JSON file?
  content: >
    Yes. Make sure to include such files as assets in your submission.

- title: Do contest submissions have to be formatted by the Dart formatter?
  content: >
    Yes. This ensures more consistent and readable code.
    <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/formatting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can do this from your IDE or at the command
    line</a>.

- title: Speaking of code formatting, what are some good coding practices for Flutter?
  content: >
    Check out <a href="https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective Dart</a>.
    (Note that the Flutter codebase has its own formatting guidelines and doesn't adhere to Effective Dart.)

- title: Can a team of people submit a single clock?
  content: >
    A team of people can work on a single clock, but the person submitting the clock through our form should be
    authorized to submit the clock (including all code and assets) on behalf of every person in the entire team, and
    each winning clock is only eligible for 1 prize.

- title: Do assets (art, fonts) also have to be created by participants?
  content: >
    All assets must comply with our
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybyQCK8Sy7vrD9wuc6pbgwVkyrVZ7Rd_41r5NXGqlt8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Official Rules</a> for submissions, and participants must either create or have permission to use (e.g. via a license) and
    submit all parts of their submission.

- title: Do you retain copyright ownership if you submit app to Flutter clock challenge?
  content: >
    By submitting, you are agreeing to release the app under an open source license, and are giving Google a license to
    the app. Please see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybyQCK8Sy7vrD9wuc6pbgwVkyrVZ7Rd_41r5NXGqlt8/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Official Rules</a> for more details.

- title: My clock looks or behaves differently on web! What do I do?
  content: >
    We will not be judging your clock on web. Web is currently in technical preview and is missing some features, but is
    a great way to share your app with others.

- title: If I have more questions, where should I go?
  content: >
    Take a look through our
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybyQCK8Sy7vrD9wuc6pbgwVkyrVZ7Rd_41r5NXGqlt8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Official Rules</a> and, if you still have questions, please
    <a href="http://github.com/flutter/flutter_clock/issues" target="_blank">file a Flutter Clock GitHub issue</a>.

- title: How can I share my clock face online?
  content: >
    We’re glad you asked! Flutter’s web support is in technical preview and you can use to share your clock face online.
    Once you <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enable web support</a>, test your app by selecting
    Chrome as the target device in your IDE, or at the command line with <em>flutter run -d chrome</em>. Build a web
    version of your app for deployment using <em>flutter build web</em>. Then, you can host it using
    <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/flutter/must-try-use-firebase-to-host-your-flutter-app-on-the-web-852ee533a469" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase</a>,
    or any other web hosting solution. If you share a link to your app on social media, be sure to include the
    #FlutterClock hashtag!
