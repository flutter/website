### Additional Windows requirements

For Windows desktop development,
you need the following in addition to the Flutter SDK:

* [Visual Studio 2022][] or [Visual Studio Build Tools 2022][]
  When installing Visual Studio or only the Build Tools,
  you need the "Desktop development with C++" workload installed
  for building windows, including all of its default components.

  **Visual Studio** is different than Visual Studio _Code_.
