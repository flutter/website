## Welcome! 

Welcome to the Flutter tutorial! This tutorial teaches you how to build 
applications from scratch that run on mobile, desktop, and web.

You’ll start from the very beginning: creating a blank Flutter application. 
By the end, you’ll have built a handful of small apps that demonstrate 
the critical features of Flutter development (and more!)

## What is Flutter?

Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit that helps you build natively compiled, 
expressive apps across mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. 
It’s declarative, reactive, features hot reload for fast development cycles, 
and has a rich set of customizable widgets for creating expressive interfaces.

Flutter draws every pixel itself rather than wrapping native components, 
giving developers complete control over the UI and ensuring visual consistency 
across platforms.

## How to use this tutorial

You should be familiar with the Dart programming language to follow this
tutorial. This tutorial assumes you have all the knowledge from its Dart
counterpart, the [Learn Dart tutorial][]. (Alternatively, if you’re comfortable
with another all-purpose object oriented language, like Java or Kotlin, you’ll
likely be okay.)

## Set up

While reading this tutorial, you’ll ideally be coding along with the examples presented. 
You can do so by [installing Flutter on your machine][], 
or by using [Firebase Studio][], a web IDE that supports Flutter.

If you’re running locally, this tutorial assumes that you’re running Flutter
apps on the web, using [Chrome][]. This doesn’t require Xcode or Android Studio, 
and thus is the quickest way to start using Flutter.
