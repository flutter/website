Given that Flutter is a UI toolkit, you'll spend a lot of time creating layouts
with Flutter widgets. In this section, you'll learn how to build layouts with
some of the most common layout widgets, including high-level widgets like
[`Scaffold`][] and [`AppBar`][], which lay out the structure of a screen, to
lower-level widgets like [`Column`][] or [`Row`][] 
that lay out widgets vertically or horizontally.

## `Scaffold` and `AppBar`

Mobile applications often have a bar at the top called an “app bar” that can
display a title, navigation controls, and/or actions. 

<img src='/assets/images/docs/tutorial/apppad.png' alt="A screenshot of a simple application with a bar across the top that has a title and settings button.">

The simplest way to add an appbar to your app is by using two widgets:
`Scaffold` and `AppBar`.

`Scaffold` is a convenience widget that provides a Material-style page layout,
making it simple to add an app bar, drawer, navigation bar, and more to a page of
your app. `AppBar` is, of course, the app bar.

The code generated from the `$ flutter create --empty` command already contains
an `AppBar` widget and a `Scaffold` widget. The following code updates it to use an
additional layout widget: [`Align`][]. This positions the title to the left,
which would be centered by default. The `Text` widget contains the
title itself.

Modify the `Scaffold` within your `MainApp`'s `build` method:

```dart
class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MainApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Align(
            alignment: Alignment.centerLeft,
            child: Text('Birdle'),
          ),
        ),
        body: Center(child: Tile('A', HitType.hit)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### An updated widget tree

Note that your app's widget tree gets more important as your app
grows. At this point, there's a "branch" in the widget tree for the first
time, and it now looks like the following figure.

## Create the GamePage widget

Add the following code for a new widget, called `GamePage`, to your `main.dart`
file. This widget will eventually display the UI elements needed for the game
itself.

```dart
class GamePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const GamePage({super.key});
  // This manages game logic, and is out of scope for this lesson
  final Game _game = Game();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // TODO: Replace with screen contents
    return Container();
  }
}
```

:::note Challenge - Display the `GamePage` rather than a `Tile`.

**Solution:**

```dart
class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MainApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        // Changed from `Tile` 
        body: Center(child: GamePage()),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Arrange widgets with `Column` and `Row`

The `GamePage` layout contains the grid of tiles that display a user’s guesses.

<img src='/assets/images/docs/tutorial/birdle.png' alt="A screenshot that resembles the popular game Wordle.">

There are a number of ways you can build this layout, and the simplest is with
`Column` and `Row` widgets.  Each row contains five tiles that represent the
five letters in a guess, with five rows total. You’ll need a column
with five rows, each row containing five children.
First, return a `Column` (wrapped with a `Padding`
widget) from the `GamePage.build` method.

```dart
class GamePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const GamePage({super.key});
  // This manages game logic, and is out of scope for this lesson
  final Game _game = Game();

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        child: Column(
          spacing: 5.0,
          children: [
            // Add children next
          ],
        ),
      );
    }`
}
```

The `spacing` property puts five pixels between each element on the main axis.

Within `Column.children`, add one row *for each* element in the `_game.guesses`
list. 

:::note 
This `guesses` list is a **fixed-size** list, starting with five
elements, one for each *potential* guess. The list will always contain exactly five
elements, and therefore will always render five rows. 
:::

```dart
class GamePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const GamePage({super.key});
  // This manages game logic, and is out of scope for this lesson
  final Game _game = Game();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: Column(
        spacing: 5.0,
        children: [
          for (var guess in _game.guesses)
              Row(
                spacing: 5.0,
                children: [
                // tiles
                ]
              ),
          ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

This is called a [collection-for][] loop, a Dart feature that allows you to
unfurl a list inside of another list when the loop is executed.
This syntactic sugar makes it easier for you to work
with collections of widgets and achieves the same as the following psuedo code:

```dart
[...ListOfData.map((element) => Widget(element)).toList()],
```

In this case, it adds five `Row` widgets to the column, one for each guess
on the `Game` object.

### An updated widget tree

The widget tree for this app has expanded significantly in this
lesson. Now, it looks more like the following figure (although it's
abridged for legibility.)

### An updated widget tree

Considering your app's widget tree gets more important as your app
grows. At this point, there's a "branch" in the tree for the first
time, and it now looks like the following figure.

:::note Challenge

Add a `Tile` to each row for each letter allowed in the guess. 
The `guess` variable in the loop is a [record][] with the type 
`({String char, HitType type})`.

**Solution:**

```dart
class GamePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const GamePage({super.key});
  // This manages game logic, and is out of scope for this lesson
  final Game _game = Game();
    
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: Column(
        spacing: 5.0,
        children: [
            for (var guess in _game.guesses)
              Row(
                spacing: 5.0,
                children: [
                  for (var letter in guess) 
                    Tile(letter.char, letter.type),
                ]
              ),
          ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

When you reload your app, you should see a 5x5 grid of white squares.
