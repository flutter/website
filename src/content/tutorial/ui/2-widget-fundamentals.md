In this lesson, you'll create your own custom widget, and learn about some of
the most common widgets included in the SDK.

Custom widgets allow you to reuse UI components across your app, organize
complex UI code into manageable pieces, and create cleaner, more maintainable
code.  By the end of this lesson, you’ll have created your own custom Tile
widget.


## Anatomy of a stateless widget

A `Widget` is a Dart class that extends one of the Flutter widget classes, in
this case
[`StatelessWidget`][].

Open your `main.dart` file and add this code below the `MainApp` class, which
defines a new widget called `Tile`.

```dart
class Tile extends StatelessWidget {
  const Tile(this.letter, this.hitType, {super.key});

  final String letter;
  final HitType hitType;

  // ... 
}
```

### Constructor

The `Tile` class has a [`constructor`][] that defines
what data needs to be passed into the widget to render the widget.  Here, a
`String` is passed in, which represents the guessed letter, and a `HitType`,
which is an enum value defined in the  `flutter_gse` package and used to
determine the color of the tile. (For example `HitType.hit` results in a green
tile).  Passing data into the widget is at the core of making widgets reusable.

### `Build` method

Finally, there’s the all important `build` method, which must be defined on
every widget, and will always return another widget. 

```dart
class Tile extends StatelessWidget {
  const Tile(this.letter, this.hitType, {super.key});

  final String letter;
  final HitType hitType;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
	// TODO: Replace Containter with widgets.
	return Container();
  }
}
```

## Use the custom widget

When this app is finished, there will be 25 instances of this widget on screen.
For now, though, display just one so you can see the updates as they’re made. In
the `MainApp.build` method, replace the `Text` widget with the following:

```dart
class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MainApp({super.key});

 @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Tile('A', HitType.hit), // NEW
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

At the moment, your app will be blank, because the `Tile` widget returns an
empty `Container`, which doesn’t display anything by default. 

## The `Container` widget

The `Tile` widget consists of three of the most common basic widgets:
`Container`, `Center`, and `Text`.
[`Container`][] is a
convenience widget that wraps several basic styling widgets, like `Padding`,
[`ColoredBox`][], [`SizedBox`][], [`DecoratedBox`][], and many more.  

Because the finished UI contains 25 `Tile` widgets in neat columns and rows, it
should have an explicit size. Set the width and height properties on the
`Container`. (You could also do this with a `SizedBox` widget, but you’ll use
more properties of the `Container` next.) 

```dart
class Tile extends StatelessWidget {
  const Tile(this.letter, this.hitType, {super.key});

  final String letter;
  final HitType hitType;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
	// NEW
	  return Container(
       width: 60,
       height: 60,
       // TODO: Add needed widgets
    );
  }
}
```

## BoxDecoration

Next, add a [`Border`][] to the box with the following code:

```dart
class Tile extends StatelessWidget {
  const Tile(required this.letter, required hitType, {super.key});

  final String letter;
  final HitType hitType;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
	// NEW
	return Container(
       width: 60,
       height: 60,
       decoration: BoxDecoration(
         border: Border.all(color: Colors.grey.shade300),
         // TODO: add background color
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

`BoxDecoration` is an object that knows how to add any number of decorations to
a widget, from background color to borders to box shadows and more. In this
case, you’ve added a border. When you hot reload, there should be a lightly
colored border around the white square.

When this game is complete, the color of the tile will depend on the user’s
guess. The tile will be green when the user has guessed correctly, yellow when
the letter is correct but the position is incorrect, and gray if the guess is
wrong on both axes. 

The following figure shows all three possibilities.

To achieve this in UI, use a [switch expression][] to set the
`color` of the `BoxDecoration`.

```dart
class Tile extends StatelessWidget {
  const Tile(required this.letter, required hitType, {super.key});

  final String letter;
  final HitType hitType;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
	return Container(
       width: 60,
       height: 60,
       decoration: BoxDecoration(
         border: Border.all(color: Colors.grey.shade300),
         color: switch (hitType) {
           HitType.hit => Colors.green,
           HitType.partial => Colors.yellow,
           HitType.miss => Colors.grey,
           _ => Colors.white,
        },         
        // TODO: add children
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Child widgets

Finally, add the `Center` and `Text` widgets to the `Container.child` property. 

Most widgets in the Flutter SDK have a `child` or `children` property that’s
meant to be passed a widget or a list of widgets, respectively. It's best
practice to use the same naming convention in your own custom widgets.

```dart
class Tile extends StatelessWidget {
  const Tile(required this.letter, required hitType, {super.key});

  final String letter;
  final HitType hitType;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
	return Container(
       width: 60,
       height: 60,
       decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: switch (hitType) {
          border: Border.all(color: Colors.grey.shade300),
           HitType.hit => Colors.green,
           HitType.partial => Colors.yellow,
           HitType.miss => Colors.grey,
           _ => Colors.white,
        },         
        child: Center(
          child: Text(
            letter.char.toUpperCase(),
            style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.titleLarge,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Hot reload and a green box appears. To toggle the color,
update and hot reload the `HitType` passed into the `Tile` you created:

```dart
// main.dart line ~16
// green
child: Tile('A', HitType.hit)
// grey
child: Tile('A', HitType.miss)
// yellow
child: Tile('A', HitType.partial)
```

Soon, this small box will be one of many widgets on the screen. In the next
lesson, you’ll start building the game grid itself.
