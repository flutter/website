To speed the download and installation of Flutter in China,
consider using a [mirror site][] or _mirror_.

:::important
Use mirror sites _only_ if you _trust_ the provider.
The Flutter team can't verify their reliability or security.

## Use a Flutter mirror site

The [China Flutter User Group][] (CFUG) maintains a Simplified Chinese
Flutter website [https://flutter.cn](https://flutter.cn) and a mirror.
Other mirrors can be found at the [end of this guide](#known-trusted-community-run-mirror-sites).

### Configure your machine to use a mirror site

To install or use Flutter in China, use a trustworthy Flutter mirror.
This requires setting two environment variables on your machine.

_All examples that follow presume that you are using the CFUG mirror._

To set your machine to use a mirror site:

{% tabs "china-setup-os" %}

{% tab "Windows" %}

These steps require using PowerShell.

 1. Open a new window in PowerShell to prepare to run shell commands.

 1. Set `PUB_HOSTED_URL` to your mirror site.

    ```ps
    $ $env:PUB_HOSTED_URL="https://pub.flutter-io.cn"
    ```
 
 1. Set `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` to your mirror site.

    ```ps
    $ $env:FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL="https://storage.flutter-io.cn"
    ```

 1. Download the Flutter archive from your preferred mirror site.

    For CFUG, visit their [Flutter SDK archive][],
    and download the SDK for your platform and architecture.
 
 1. Create a folder where you can install Flutter. Then change into it.
    Consider a path like `$env:USERPROFILE\dev`.

    ```ps
    $ New-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\dev" -ItemType Directory; cd "$env:USERPROFILE\dev"
    ```
 1. Extract the SDK from the zip archive file.

    This example assumes you downloaded the Windows version of the Flutter SDK.
    You'll need to replace the path to the archive with the
    path to the archive file and version you downloaded.

    ```ps
    $ Expand-Archive .\flutter_windows_3.35.5-stable.zip
    ```

 1. Add Flutter to your `PATH` environment variable.

    ```ps
    $ $env:PATH = $pwd.PATH + "\flutter\bin",$env:PATH -join ";"
    ```

 1. Begin developing with Flutter.

    After following these steps,
    Flutter fetches packages and artifacts from `flutter-io.cn`
    in the current terminal window.

    To set these values permanently across terminals,
    follow the instructions on adding [Flutter to your PATH][windows-path],
    also adding the `PUB_HOSTED_URL` and `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` variables.

{:.steps}

[windows-path]: /install/add-to-path#windows

{% endtab %}

{% tab "macOS" %}

 1. Open a new window in your terminal to prepare to run shell commands.

 1. Set `PUB_HOSTED_URL` to your mirror site.

    ```console
    $ export PUB_HOSTED_URL="https://pub.flutter-io.cn"
    ```

 1. Set `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` to your mirror site.

    ```console
    $ export FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL="https://storage.flutter-io.cn"
    ```

 1. Download the Flutter archive from your preferred mirror site.

    For CFUG, visit their [Flutter SDK archive][],
    and download the SDK for your platform and architecture.

 1. Create a folder where you can install Flutter. Then change into it.
    Consider a path like `~/dev`.

    ```console
    $ mkdir ~/dev; cd ~/dev
    ```

 1. Extract the SDK from the zip archive file.

    This example assumes you downloaded the macOS version of the Flutter SDK.
    You'll need to replace the path to the archive with the
    path to the archive file and version you downloaded.

    ```console
    $ unzip flutter_macos_3.35.5-stable.zip
    ```

 1. Add Flutter to your `PATH` environment variable.

    ```console
    $ export PATH="$PWD/flutter/bin:$PATH"
    ```

 1. Begin developing with Flutter.

    After following these steps,
    Flutter fetches packages and artifacts from `flutter-io.cn`
    in the current terminal window.

    To set these values permanently across terminals,
    follow the instructions on adding [Flutter to your PATH][macos-path],
    also adding the `PUB_HOSTED_URL` and `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` variables.

{:.steps}

[macos-path]: /install/add-to-path#macos

{% endtab %}

{% tab "Linux" %}

 1. Open a new window in your terminal to prepare to run shell commands.

 1. Set `PUB_HOSTED_URL` to your mirror site.

    ```console
    $ export PUB_HOSTED_URL="https://pub.flutter-io.cn"
    ```

 1. Set `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` to your mirror site.

    ```console
    $ export FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL="https://storage.flutter-io.cn"
    ```

 1. Download the Flutter archive from your preferred mirror site.

    For CFUG, visit their [Flutter SDK archive][],
    and download the SDK for your platform and architecture.

 1. Create a folder where you can install Flutter. Then change into it.
    Consider a path like `~/dev`.

    ```console
    $ mkdir ~/dev; cd ~/dev
    ```

 1. Extract the SDK from the tar archive file.

    This example assumes you downloaded the Linux version of the Flutter SDK.
    You'll need to replace the path to the archive with the
    path to the archive file and version you downloaded.

    ```console
    $ tar -xf flutter_linux_3.35.5-stable.tar.xz
    ```

 1. Add Flutter to your `PATH` environment variable.

    ```console
    $ export PATH="$PWD/flutter/bin:$PATH"
    ```

 1. Begin developing with Flutter.

    After following these steps,
    Flutter fetches packages and artifacts from `flutter-io.cn`
    in the current terminal window.

    To set these values permanently across terminals,
    follow the instructions on adding [Flutter to your PATH][linux-path],
    also adding the `PUB_HOSTED_URL` and `FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL` variables.

[linux-path]: /install/add-to-path#linux

### Download Flutter archives based on a mirror site

To download Flutter from the [SDK archive][] from a mirror,
replace `storage.googleapis.com` with the URL of your trusted mirror.
Use your mirror site in the browser or in other applications
like IDM or Thunder.
This should improve download speed.

[SDK archive]: /install/archive

The following example shows how to change the URL for Flutter's download site
from Google's archive to CFUG's mirror.

{% tabs "china-setup-os" %}

{% tab "Windows" %}

To download the x64, Windows version of the Flutter SDK,
you would change the original URL from:

```plaintext
[!https://storage.googleapis.com!]/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/windows/flutter_windows_3.35.5-stable.zip
```

to the mirror URL:

```plaintext
[!https://storage.flutter-io.cn!]/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/windows/flutter_windows_3.35.5-stable.zip
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab "macOS" %}

To download the arm64, macOS version of the Flutter SDK,
you would change the original URL from:

```plaintext
[!https://storage.googleapis.com!]/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/macos/flutter_macos_arm64_3.35.5-stable.zip
```

to the mirror URL:

```plaintext
[!https://storage.flutter-io.cn!]/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/macos/flutter_macos_arm64_3.35.5-stable.zip
```

{% endtab %}

{% tab "Linux" %}

To download the Linux version of the Flutter SDK,
you would change the original URL from:

```plaintext
[!https://storage.googleapis.com!]/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_3.35.5-stable.tar.xz
```

to the mirror URL:

```plaintext
[!https://storage.flutter-io.cn!]/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_3.35.5-stable.tar.xz
```

{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

:::note
Not every mirror supports downloading artifacts using their direct URL.

## Configure your machine to publish your package

To publish your packages to `pub.dev`,
you need to be able to access both Google Auth and the `pub.dev` site.

On macOS, Linux, or ChromeOS:

```console
export PUB_HOSTED_URL={{mirror.urls.pubhosted}};
export FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL={{mirror.urls.flutterstorage}}
```
