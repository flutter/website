title: Implicit animations
description: Where to find more information on using implicit animations in Flutter.
---

With Flutter's [animation library][],
you can add motion and create visual effects
for the widgets in your UI.
One part of the library is an assortment of widgets
that manage animations for you.
These widgets are collectively referred to as _implicit animations_,
or _implicitly animated widgets_, deriving their name from the
[`ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget`][] class that they implement.
The following set of resources provide many ways to learn
about implicit animations in Flutter.

## Documentation

[Implicit animations codelab][]
: Jump right into the code!
  This codelab uses interactive examples
  and step-by-step instructions to teach you
  how to use implicit animations.

[`AnimatedContainer` sample][]
: A step-by-step recipe from the [Flutter cookbook][]
  for using the [`AnimatedContainer`][]
  implicitly animated widget.

[`ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget`][] API page
: All implicit animations extend the `ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget` class.

## Widget of the Week videos

A weekly series of short animated videos each showing
the important features of one particular widget.
In about 60 seconds, you'll see real code for each
widget with a demo about how it works.
The following Widget of the Week videos cover
implicitly animated widgets:

{% assign animatedWidgets = 'AnimatedOpacity, AnimatedPadding, AnimatedPositioned, AnimatedSwitcher' | split: ", " %}
{% assign animatedUrls = 'QZAvjqOqiLY, PY2m0fhGNz4, hC3s2YdtWt8, 2W7POjFb88g' | split: ", " %}

{% for widget in animatedWidgets %}
{% assign videoUrl = animatedUrls[forloop.index0] %}
{% assign videoDescription = 'Learn about the ' | append: widget | append: ' Flutter Widget' %}

{% ytEmbed videoUrl, videoDescription %}

{% endfor -%}
