## Examples

If you'd like to see how the adaptive and responsive
concepts (as described in these pages) come together.
check out the source code for the following apps:

## Learn more about basic usability principles

Of course, these pages don't constitute an
exhaustive list of the things you might consider.
The more operating systems, form factors,
and input devices you support, the more difficult
it becomes to spec out every permutation in design.

Taking time to learn basic usability principles as a
developer empowers you to make better decisions,
reduces back-and-forth iterations with
design during production, and results in
improved productivity with better outcomes.
