  A catalog of Flutter's widgets implementing Material 3 design guidelines.
---

Flutter provides a variety of visual, behavioral, and motion-rich widgets
that implement the [Material 3][] design specification.
Material 3 is the default design language of Flutter,
enabling you to design and build beautiful, usable apps
that can adapt to any platform.

:::secondary
The transition to Material 3 as the default was
completed in Flutter 3.16.

To learn more about this transition, how to complete it for your own widgets,
or how to temporarily opt-out, check out
the [Migrate to Material 3][] migration guide.
:::

To catch these and other widgets in action,
check out the [Material 3 demo][] web app.
