The Flutter Cupertino library is a collection
of widgets that implement Apple's iOS design language
for Flutter apps. The widgets have a similar look
and feel to iOS, including rounded corners, gradients,
and minimalistic design.
They also include iOS interactions and animations.

The following 15-minute video provides a high-level
