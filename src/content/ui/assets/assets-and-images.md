<?code-excerpt path-base="ui/assets_and_images/lib"?>

Flutter apps can include both code and _assets_
(sometimes called resources). An asset is a file
that is bundled and deployed with your app,
and is accessible at runtime. Common types of assets include
static data (for example, JSON files),
configuration files, icons, and images
(JPEG, WebP, GIF, animated WebP/GIF, PNG, BMP, and WBMP).

## Specifying assets

Flutter uses the [`pubspec.yaml`][] file,
located at the root of your project,
to identify assets required by an app.

Here is an example:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/my_icon.png
    - assets/background.png
```

To include all assets under a directory,
specify the directory name with the `/` character at the end:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - directory/
    - directory/subdirectory/
```

:::note
Only files located directly in the directory are included.
[Resolution-aware asset image variants](#resolution-aware) are the only exception.
To add files located in subdirectories, create an entry per directory.
:::

:::note
Indentation matters in YAML. If you see an error like
`Error: unable to find directory entry in pubspec.yaml`
then you _might_ have indented incorrectly in your
pubspec file. Consider the following [broken] example:
```yaml
flutter:
assets:
  - directory/
```
The `assets:` line should be indented by exactly
two spaces below the `flutter:` line:
```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - directory/
```
:::

### Asset bundling

The `assets` subsection of the `flutter` section
specifies files that should be included with the app.
Each asset is identified by an explicit path
(relative to the `pubspec.yaml` file) where the asset
file is located. The order in which the assets are
declared doesn't matter. The actual directory name used
(`assets` in first example or `directory` in the above
example) doesn't matter.

During a build, Flutter places assets into a special
archive called the _asset bundle_ that apps read
from at runtime.

### Automatic transformation of asset files at build time

Flutter supports using a Dart package to transform asset files when building your app.
To do this, specify the asset files and transformer package in your pubspec file.
To learn how to do this and write your own asset-transforming packages, see
[Transforming assets at build time][].

## Loading assets

Your app can access its assets through an
[`AssetBundle`][] object.

The two main methods on an asset bundle allow you to load a
string/text asset (`loadString()`) or an image/binary asset (`load()`)
out of the bundle, given a logical key. The logical key maps to the path
to the asset specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file at build time.

### Loading text assets

Each Flutter app has a [`rootBundle`][]
object for easy access to the main asset bundle.
It is possible to load assets directly using the
`rootBundle` global static from
`package:flutter/services.dart`.

However, it's recommended to obtain the `AssetBundle`
for the current `BuildContext` using
[`DefaultAssetBundle`][], rather than the default
asset bundle that was built with the app; this
approach enables a parent widget to substitute a
different `AssetBundle` at run time,
which can be useful for localization or testing
scenarios.

Typically, you'll use `DefaultAssetBundle.of()`
to indirectly load an asset, for example a JSON file,
from the app's runtime `rootBundle`.

{% comment %}
  Need example here to show obtaining the AssetBundle for the current
  BuildContext using DefaultAssetBundle.of
{% endcomment %}

Outside of a `Widget` context, or when a handle
to an `AssetBundle` is not available,
you can use `rootBundle` to directly load such assets.
For example:

<?code-excerpt "main.dart (root-bundle-load)"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/services.dart' show rootBundle;

Future<String> loadAsset() async {
  return await rootBundle.loadString('assets/config.json');
}
```

### Loading images

To load an image, use the [`AssetImage`][]
class in a widget's `build()` method.

For example, your app can load the background
image from the asset declarations in the previous example:

<?code-excerpt "main.dart (background-image)"?>
```dart
return const Image(image: AssetImage('assets/background.png'));
```

### Resolution-aware image assets {:#resolution-aware}

Flutter can load resolution-appropriate images for
the current [device pixel ratio][].

[`AssetImage`][] will map a logical requested
asset onto one that most closely matches the current
[device pixel ratio][].

For this mapping to work, assets should be arranged
according to a particular directory structure:

```plaintext
.../image.png
.../Mx/image.png
.../Nx/image.png
...etc.
```

Where _M_ and _N_ are numeric identifiers that correspond
to the nominal resolution of the images contained within.
In other words, they specify the device pixel ratio that
the images are intended for.

In this example, `image.png` is considered the *main asset*,
while `Mx/image.png` and `Nx/image.png` are considered to be
*variants*.

The main asset is assumed to correspond to a resolution of 1.0.
For example, consider the following asset layout for an
image named `my_icon.png`:

```plaintext
.../my_icon.png       (mdpi baseline)
.../1.5x/my_icon.png  (hdpi)
.../2.0x/my_icon.png  (xhdpi)
.../3.0x/my_icon.png  (xxhdpi)
.../4.0x/my_icon.png  (xxxhdpi)
```

On devices with a device pixel ratio of 1.8, the asset
`.../2.0x/my_icon.png` is chosen.
For a device pixel ratio of 2.7, the asset
`.../3.0x/my_icon.png` is chosen.

If the width and height of the rendered image are not specified
on the `Image` widget, the nominal resolution is used to scale
the asset so that it occupies the same amount of screen space
as the main asset would have, just with a higher resolution.
That is, if `.../my_icon.png` is 72px by 72px, then
`.../3.0x/my_icon.png` should be 216px by 216px;
but they both render into 72px by 72px (in logical pixels),
if width and height are not specified.

:::note
[Device pixel ratio][] depends on [MediaQueryData.size][], which requires having either
[MaterialApp][] or [CupertinoApp][] as an ancestor of your [`AssetImage`][].
:::

#### Bundling of resolution-aware image assets {:#resolution-aware-bundling}

You only need to specify the main asset or its parent directory
in the `assets` section of `pubspec.yaml`.
Flutter bundles the variants for you.
Each entry should correspond to a real file, with the exception of
the main asset entry. If the main asset entry doesn't correspond
to a real file, then the asset with the lowest resolution
is used as the fallback for devices with device pixel
ratios below that resolution. The entry should still
be included in the `pubspec.yaml` manifest, however.

Anything using the default asset bundle inherits resolution
awareness when loading images. (If you work with some of the lower
level classes, like [`ImageStream`][] or [`ImageCache`][],
you'll also notice parameters related to scale.)

### Asset images in package dependencies {:#from-packages}

To load an image from a [package][] dependency,
the `package` argument must be provided to [`AssetImage`][].

For instance, suppose your application depends on a package
called `my_icons`, which has the following directory structure:

```plaintext
.../pubspec.yaml
.../icons/heart.png
.../icons/1.5x/heart.png
.../icons/2.0x/heart.png
...etc.
```

To load the image, use:

<?code-excerpt "main.dart (package-image)"?>
```dart
return const AssetImage('icons/heart.png', package: 'my_icons');
```

Assets used by the package itself should also be fetched
using the `package` argument as above.

#### Bundling of package assets

If the desired asset is specified in the `pubspec.yaml`
file of the package, it's bundled automatically with the
application. In particular, assets used by the package
itself must be specified in its `pubspec.yaml`.

A package can also choose to have assets in its `lib/`
folder that are not specified in its `pubspec.yaml` file.
In this case, for those images to be bundled,
the application has to specify which ones to include in its
`pubspec.yaml`. For instance, a package named `fancy_backgrounds`
could have the following files:

```plaintext
.../lib/backgrounds/background1.png
.../lib/backgrounds/background2.png
.../lib/backgrounds/background3.png
```

To include, say, the first image, the `pubspec.yaml` of the
application should specify it in the `assets` section:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - packages/fancy_backgrounds/backgrounds/background1.png
```

The `lib/` is implied,
so it should not be included in the asset path.

If you are developing a package, to load an asset within the package, specify it in the `pubspec.yaml` of the package:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```

To load the image within your package, use:

```dart
return const AssetImage('packages/fancy_backgrounds/backgrounds/background1.png');
```

## Sharing assets with the underlying platform

Flutter assets are readily available to platform code
using the `AssetManager` on Android and `NSBundle` on iOS.

### Loading Flutter assets in Android

On Android the assets are available through the
[`AssetManager`][] API.  The lookup key used in,
for instance [`openFd`][], is obtained from
`lookupKeyForAsset` on [`PluginRegistry.Registrar`][] or
`getLookupKeyForAsset` on [`FlutterView`][].
`PluginRegistry.Registrar` is available when developing a plugin
while `FlutterView` would be the choice when developing an
app including a platform view.

As an example, suppose you have specified the following
in your pubspec.yaml

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - icons/heart.png
```

This reflects the following structure in your Flutter app.

```plaintext
.../pubspec.yaml
.../icons/heart.png
...etc.
```

To access `icons/heart.png` from your Java plugin code,
do the following:

```java
AssetManager assetManager = registrar.context().getAssets();
String key = registrar.lookupKeyForAsset("icons/heart.png");
AssetFileDescriptor fd = assetManager.openFd(key);
```

### Loading Flutter assets in iOS

On iOS the assets are available through the [`mainBundle`][].
The lookup key used in, for instance [`pathForResource:ofType:`][],
is obtained from `lookupKeyForAsset` or `lookupKeyForAsset:fromPackage:`
on [`FlutterPluginRegistrar`][], or `lookupKeyForAsset:` or
`lookupKeyForAsset:fromPackage:` on [`FlutterViewController`][].
`FlutterPluginRegistrar` is available when developing
a plugin while `FlutterViewController` would be the choice
when developing an app including a platform view.

As an example, suppose you have the Flutter setting from above.

To access `icons/heart.png` from your Objective-C plugin code you
would do the following:

```objc
NSString* key = [registrar lookupKeyForAsset:@"icons/heart.png"];
NSString* path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:key ofType:nil];
```

To access `icons/heart.png` from your Swift app you
would do the following:

```swift
let key = controller.lookupKey(forAsset: "icons/heart.png")
let mainBundle = Bundle.main
let path = mainBundle.path(forResource: key, ofType: nil)
```

For a more complete example, see the implementation of the
Flutter [`video_player` plugin][] on pub.dev.

The [`ios_platform_images`][] plugin on pub.dev wraps
up this logic in a convenient category. You fetch
an image as follows:

**Objective-C:**
```objc
[UIImage flutterImageWithName:@"icons/heart.png"];
```

**Swift:**
```swift
UIImage.flutterImageNamed("icons/heart.png")
```

### Loading iOS images in Flutter

When implementing Flutter by
[adding it to an existing iOS app][add-to-app],
you might have images hosted in iOS that you
want to use in Flutter. To accomplish
that, use the [`ios_platform_images`][] plugin
available on pub.dev.

## Platform assets

There are other occasions to work with assets in the
platform projects directly. Below are two common cases
where assets are used before the Flutter framework is
loaded and running.

### Updating the app icon

Updating a Flutter application's launch icon works
the same way as updating launch icons in native
Android or iOS applications.

![Launch icon](/assets/images/docs/assets-and-images/icon.png)

#### Android

In your Flutter project's root directory, navigate to
`.../android/app/src/main/res`. The various bitmap resource
folders such as `mipmap-hdpi` already contain placeholder
images named `ic_launcher.png`. Replace them with your
desired assets respecting the recommended icon size per
screen density as indicated by the [Android Developer Guide][].

![Android icon location](/assets/images/docs/assets-and-images/android-icon-path.png)

:::note
If you rename the `.png` files, you must also update the
corresponding name in your `AndroidManifest.xml`'s
`<application>` tag's `android:icon` attribute.
:::

#### iOS

In your Flutter project's root directory,
navigate to `.../ios/Runner`. The
`Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` directory already contains
placeholder images. Replace them with the appropriately
sized images as indicated by their filename as dictated by the
Apple [Human Interface Guidelines][].
Keep the original file names.

![iOS icon location](/assets/images/docs/assets-and-images/ios-icon-path.png)

### Updating the launch screen

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/docs/assets-and-images/launch-screen.png" alt="Launch screen" />
</p>

Flutter also uses native platform mechanisms to draw
transitional launch screens to your Flutter app while the
Flutter framework loads. This launch screen persists until
Flutter renders the first frame of your application.

:::note
This implies that if you don't call [`runApp()`][] in the
`main()` function of your app (or more specifically,
if you don't call [`FlutterView.render()`][] in response to
[`PlatformDispatcher.onDrawFrame`][]),
the launch screen persists forever.
:::

[`FlutterView.render()`]: {{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/FlutterView/render.html
[`PlatformDispatcher.onDrawFrame`]: {{site.api}}/flutter/dart-ui/PlatformDispatcher/onDrawFrame.html

#### Android

To add a launch screen (also known as "splash screen") to your
Flutter application, navigate to `.../android/app/src/main`.
In `res/drawable/launch_background.xml`,
use this [layer list drawable][] XML to customize
the look of your launch screen. The existing template provides
an example of adding an image to the middle of a white splash
screen in commented code. You can uncomment it or use other
[drawables][] to achieve the intended effect.

For more details, see
[Adding a splash screen to your Android app][].

#### iOS

To add an image to the center of your "splash screen",
navigate to `.../ios/Runner`.
In `Assets.xcassets/LaunchImage.imageset`,
drop in images named `LaunchImage.png`,
`LaunchImage@2x.png`, `LaunchImage@3x.png`.
If you use different filenames,
update the `Contents.json` file in the same directory.

You can also fully customize your launch screen storyboard
in Xcode by opening `.../ios/Runner.xcworkspace`.
Navigate to `Runner/Runner` in the Project Navigator and
drop in images by opening `Assets.xcassets` or do any
customization using the Interface Builder in
`LaunchScreen.storyboard`.
