Flutter widgets are built using a modern framework that takes
inspiration from [React][]. The central idea is that you build
your UI out of widgets. Widgets describe what their view
should look like given their current configuration and state.
When a widget's state changes, the widget rebuilds its description,
which the framework diffs against the previous description in order
to determine the minimal changes needed in the underlying render
tree to transition from one state to the next.

## Hello world

The minimal Flutter app simply calls the [`runApp()`][]
function with a widget:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart"?>
```dartpad title="Flutter Hello World hands-on example in DartPad" run="true"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    const Center(
      child: Text(
        'Hello, world!',
        textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
        style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

The `runApp()` function takes the given
[`Widget`][] and makes it the root of the widget tree.
In this example, the widget tree consists of two widgets,
the [`Center`][] widget and its child, the [`Text`][] widget.
The framework forces the root widget to cover the screen,
which means the text "Hello, world" ends up centered on screen.
The text direction needs to be specified in this instance;
when the `MaterialApp` widget is used,
this is taken care of for you, as demonstrated later.

When writing an app, you'll commonly author new widgets that
are subclasses of either [`StatelessWidget`][] or [`StatefulWidget`][],
depending on whether your widget manages any state.
A widget's main job is to implement a [`build()`][] function,
which describes the widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets.
The framework builds those widgets in turn until the process
bottoms out in widgets that represent the underlying [`RenderObject`][],
which computes and describes the geometry of the widget.

## Basic widgets

Flutter comes with a suite of powerful basic widgets,
of which the following are commonly used:

**[`Text`][]**
: The `Text` widget lets you create a run of styled text
  within your application.

**[`Row`][], [`Column`][]**
: These flex widgets let you create flexible layouts in
  both the horizontal (`Row`) and vertical (`Column`) directions.
  The design of these objects is based on the web's
  flexbox layout model.

**[`Stack`][]**
: Instead of being linearly oriented (either horizontally or vertically),
  a `Stack` widget lets you place widgets on top of each other in paint order.
  You can then use the [`Positioned`][] widget on children of a
  `Stack` to position them relative to the top, right, bottom,
  or left edge of the stack. Stacks are based on the web's
  absolute positioning layout model.

**[`Container`][]**
: The `Container` widget lets you create a rectangular visual element.
  A container can be decorated with a [`BoxDecoration`][], such as a
  background, a border, or a shadow. A `Container` can also have margins,
  padding, and constraints applied to its size. In addition, a
  `Container` can be transformed in three-dimensional space using a matrix.

Below are some simple widgets that combine these and other widgets:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main_myappbar.dart"?>
```dartpad title="Flutter combining widgets hands-on example in DartPad" run="true"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyAppBar extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyAppBar({required this.title, super.key});

  // Fields in a Widget subclass are always marked "final".

  final Widget title;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      height: 56, // in logical pixels
      padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8),
      decoration: BoxDecoration(color: Colors.blue[500]),
      // Row is a horizontal, linear layout.
      child: Row(
        children: [
          const IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
            tooltip: 'Navigation menu',
            onPressed: null, // null disables the button
          ),
          // Expanded expands its child
          // to fill the available space.
          Expanded(child: title),
          const IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            tooltip: 'Search',
            onPressed: null,
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MyScaffold extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyScaffold({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Material is a conceptual piece
    // of paper on which the UI appears.
    return Material(
      // Column is a vertical, linear layout.
      child: Column(
        children: [
          MyAppBar(
            title: Text(
              'Example title',
              style:
                  Theme.of(context) //
                  .primaryTextTheme.titleLarge,
            ),
          ),
          const Expanded(child: Center(child: Text('Hello, world!'))),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    const MaterialApp(
      title: 'My app', // used by the OS task switcher
      home: SafeArea(child: MyScaffold()),
    ),
  );
}
```

Be sure to have a `uses-material-design: true` entry in the `flutter`
section of your `pubspec.yaml` file. It allows you to use the predefined
set of [Material icons][]. It's generally a good idea to include this line
if you are using the Materials library.

```yaml
name: my_app
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
```

Many Material Design widgets need to be inside of a [`MaterialApp`][]
to display properly, in order to inherit theme data.
Therefore, run the application with a `MaterialApp`.

The `MyAppBar` widget creates a [`Container`][] with a height of 56
device-independent pixels with an internal padding of 8 pixels,
both on the left and the right. Inside the container,
`MyAppBar` uses a [`Row`][] layout to organize its children.
The middle child, the `title` widget, is marked as [`Expanded`][],
which means it expands to fill any remaining available space
that hasn't been consumed by the other children.
You can have multiple `Expanded` children and determine the
ratio in which they consume the available space using the
[`flex`][] argument to `Expanded`.

The `MyScaffold` widget organizes its children in a vertical column.
At the top of the column it places an instance of `MyAppBar`,
passing the app bar a [`Text`][] widget to use as its title.
Passing widgets as arguments to other widgets is a powerful technique
that lets you create generic widgets that can be reused in a wide
variety of ways. Finally, `MyScaffold` uses an
[`Expanded`][] to fill the remaining space with its body,
which consists of a centered message.

For more information, check out [Layouts][].

## Using Material Components

Flutter provides a number of widgets that help you build apps
that follow Material Design. A Material app starts with the
[`MaterialApp`][] widget, which builds a number of useful widgets
at the root of your app, including a [`Navigator`][],
which manages a stack of widgets identified by strings,
also known as "routes". The `Navigator` lets you transition smoothly
between screens of your application. Using the [`MaterialApp`][]
widget is entirely optional but a good practice.

<?code-excerpt "lib/main_tutorial.dart"?>
```dartpad title="Flutter Material design hands-on example in DartPad" run="true"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MaterialApp(title: 'Flutter Tutorial', home: TutorialHome()));
}

class TutorialHome extends StatelessWidget {
  const TutorialHome({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold is a layout for
    // the major Material Components.
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        leading: const IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
          tooltip: 'Navigation menu',
          onPressed: null,
        ),
        title: const Text('Example title'),
        actions: const [
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            tooltip: 'Search',
            onPressed: null,
          ),
        ],
      ),
      // body is the majority of the screen.
      body: const Center(child: Text('Hello, world!')),
      floatingActionButton: const FloatingActionButton(
        tooltip: 'Add', // used by assistive technologies
        onPressed: null,
        child: Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Now that the code has switched from `MyAppBar` and `MyScaffold` to the
[`AppBar`][] and [`Scaffold`][] widgets, and from `material.dart`,
the app is starting to look a bit more Material.
For example, the app bar has a shadow and the title text inherits the
correct styling automatically. A floating action button is also added.

Notice that widgets are passed as arguments to other widgets.
The [`Scaffold`][] widget takes a number of different widgets as
named arguments, each of which are placed in the `Scaffold`
layout in the appropriate place. Similarly, the
[`AppBar`][] widget lets you pass in widgets for the
[`leading`][] widget, and the [`actions`][] of the [`title`][] widget.
This pattern recurs throughout the framework and is something you
might consider when designing your own widgets.

For more information, check out [Material Components widgets][].

Material is one of the 2 bundled designs included with Flutter.

check out the [Cupertino components][] package,
which has its own versions of
[`CupertinoApp`][], and [`CupertinoNavigationBar`][].

## Handling gestures

Most applications include some form of user interaction with the system.
The first step in building an interactive application is to detect
input gestures. See how that works by creating a simple button:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main_mybutton.dart"?>
```dartpad title="Flutter button hands-on example in DartPad" run="true"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyButton extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyButton({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: () {
        print('MyButton was tapped!');
      },
      child: Container(
        height: 50,
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
        margin: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 8),
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(5),
          color: Colors.lightGreen[500],
        ),
        child: const Center(child: Text('Engage')),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(const MaterialApp(home: Scaffold(body: Center(child: MyButton()))));
}
```

The [`GestureDetector`][] widget doesn't have a visual
representation but instead detects gestures made by the
user. When the user taps the [`Container`][],
the `GestureDetector` calls its [`onTap()`][] callback, in this
case printing a message to the console. You can use
`GestureDetector` to detect a variety of input gestures,
including taps, drags, and scales.

Many widgets use a [`GestureDetector`][] to provide
optional callbacks for other widgets. For example, the
[`IconButton`][], [`ElevatedButton`][], and
[`FloatingActionButton`][] widgets have [`onPressed()`][]
callbacks that are triggered when the user taps the widget.

For more information, check out [Gestures in Flutter][].

## Changing widgets in response to input

So far, this page has used only stateless widgets.
Stateless widgets receive arguments from their parent widget,
which they store in [`final`][] member variables.
When a widget is asked to [`build()`][], it uses these stored
values to derive new arguments for the widgets it creates.

In order to build more complex experiences&mdash;for example,
to react in more interesting ways to user input&mdash;applications
typically carry some state. Flutter uses `StatefulWidgets` to capture
this idea. `StatefulWidgets` are special widgets that know how to generate
`State` objects, which are then used to hold state.
Consider this basic example, using the [`ElevatedButton`][] mentioned earlier:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main_counter.dart"?>
```dartpad title="Flutter state management hands-on example in DartPad" run="true"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class Counter extends StatefulWidget {
  // This class is the configuration for the state.
  // It holds the values (in this case nothing) provided
  // by the parent and used by the build  method of the
  // State. Fields in a Widget subclass are always marked
  // "final".

  const Counter({super.key});

  @override
  State<Counter> createState() => _CounterState();
}

class _CounterState extends State<Counter> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _increment() {
    setState(() {
      // This call to setState tells the Flutter framework
      // that something has changed in this State, which
      // causes it to rerun the build method below so that
      // the display can reflect the updated values. If you
      // change _counter without calling setState(), then
      // the build method won't be called again, and so
      // nothing would appear to happen.
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // This method is rerun every time setState is called,
    // for instance, as done by the _increment method above.
    // The Flutter framework has been optimized to make
    // rerunning build methods fast, so that you can just
    // rebuild anything that needs updating rather than
    // having to individually changes instances of widgets.
    return Row(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        ElevatedButton(onPressed: _increment, child: const Text('Increment')),
        const SizedBox(width: 16),
        Text('Count: $_counter'),
      ],
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(const MaterialApp(home: Scaffold(body: Center(child: Counter()))));
}
```

You might wonder why `StatefulWidget` and `State` are separate objects.
In Flutter, these two types of objects have different life cycles.
`Widgets` are temporary objects, used to construct a presentation of
the application in its current state. `State` objects, on the other
hand, are persistent between calls to
`build()`, allowing them to remember information.

The example above accepts user input and directly uses
the result in its `build()` method.  In more complex applications,
different parts of the widget hierarchy might be
responsible for different concerns; for example, one
widget might present a complex user interface
with the goal of gathering specific information,
such as a date or location, while another widget might
use that information to change the overall presentation.

In Flutter, change notifications flow "up" the widget
hierarchy by way of callbacks, while current state flows
"down" to the stateless widgets that do presentation.
The common parent that redirects this flow is the `State`.
The following slightly more complex example shows how
this works in practice:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main_counterdisplay.dart"?>
```dartpad title="Flutter Hello World hands-on example in DartPad" run="true"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class CounterDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  const CounterDisplay({required this.count, super.key});

  final int count;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text('Count: $count');
  }
}

class CounterIncrementor extends StatelessWidget {
  const CounterIncrementor({required this.onPressed, super.key});

  final VoidCallback onPressed;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(onPressed: onPressed, child: const Text('Increment'));
  }
}

class Counter extends StatefulWidget {
  const Counter({super.key});

  @override
  State<Counter> createState() => _CounterState();
}

class _CounterState extends State<Counter> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _increment() {
    setState(() {
      ++_counter;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
        CounterIncrementor(onPressed: _increment),
        const SizedBox(width: 16),
        CounterDisplay(count: _counter),
      ],
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(const MaterialApp(home: Scaffold(body: Center(child: Counter()))));
}
```

Notice the creation of two new stateless widgets,
cleanly separating the concerns of _displaying_ the counter
(`CounterDisplay`) and _changing_ the counter (`CounterIncrementor`).
Although the net result is the same as the previous example,
the separation of responsibility allows greater complexity to
be encapsulated in the individual widgets,
while maintaining simplicity in the parent.

## Bringing it all together

What follows is a more complete example that brings together
these concepts: A hypothetical shopping application displays various
products offered for sale, and maintains a shopping cart for
intended purchases. Start by defining the presentation class,
`ShoppingListItem`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main_shoppingitem.dart"?>
```dartpad title="Flutter complete shopping list item hands-on example in DartPad" run="true"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class Product {
  const Product({required this.name});

  final String name;
}

typedef CartChangedCallback = Function(Product product, bool inCart);

class ShoppingListItem extends StatelessWidget {
  ShoppingListItem({
    required this.product,
    required this.inCart,
    required this.onCartChanged,
  }) : super(key: ObjectKey(product));

  final Product product;
  final bool inCart;
  final CartChangedCallback onCartChanged;

  Color _getColor(BuildContext context) {
    // The theme depends on the BuildContext because different
    // parts of the tree can have different themes.
    // The BuildContext indicates where the build is
    // taking place and therefore which theme to use.

    return inCart //
        ? Colors.black54
        : Theme.of(context).primaryColor;
  }

  TextStyle? _getTextStyle(BuildContext context) {
    if (!inCart) return null;

    return const TextStyle(
      color: Colors.black54,
      decoration: TextDecoration.lineThrough,
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListTile(
      onTap: () {
        onCartChanged(product, inCart);
      },
      leading: CircleAvatar(
        backgroundColor: _getColor(context),
        child: Text(product.name[0]),
      ),
      title: Text(product.name, style: _getTextStyle(context)),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: ShoppingListItem(
            product: const Product(name: 'Chips'),
            inCart: true,
            onCartChanged: (product, inCart) {},
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

The `ShoppingListItem` widget follows a common pattern
for stateless widgets.  It stores the values it receives
in its constructor in [`final`][] member variables,
which it then uses during its [`build()`][] function.
For example, the `inCart` boolean toggles between two visual
appearances: one that uses the primary color from the current
theme, and another that uses gray.

When the user taps the list item, the widget doesn't modify
its `inCart` value directly. Instead, the widget calls the
`onCartChanged` function it received from its parent widget.
This pattern lets you store state higher in the widget
hierarchy, which causes the state to persist for longer periods of time.
In the extreme, the state stored on the widget passed to
[`runApp()`][] persists for the lifetime of the
application.

When the parent receives the `onCartChanged` callback,
the parent updates its internal state, which triggers
the parent to rebuild and create a new instance
of `ShoppingListItem` with the new `inCart` value.
Although the parent creates a new instance of
`ShoppingListItem` when it rebuilds, that operation is cheap
because the framework compares the newly built widgets with the previously
built widgets and applies only the differences to the underlying
[`RenderObject`][].

Here's an example parent widget that stores mutable state:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main_shoppinglist.dart"?>
```dartpad title="Flutter storing mutable state hands-on example in DartPad" run="true"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class Product {
  const Product({required this.name});

  final String name;
}

typedef CartChangedCallback = Function(Product product, bool inCart);

class ShoppingListItem extends StatelessWidget {
  ShoppingListItem({
    required this.product,
    required this.inCart,
    required this.onCartChanged,
  }) : super(key: ObjectKey(product));

  final Product product;
  final bool inCart;
  final CartChangedCallback onCartChanged;

  Color _getColor(BuildContext context) {
    // The theme depends on the BuildContext because different
    // parts of the tree can have different themes.
    // The BuildContext indicates where the build is
    // taking place and therefore which theme to use.

    return inCart //
        ? Colors.black54
        : Theme.of(context).primaryColor;
  }

  TextStyle? _getTextStyle(BuildContext context) {
    if (!inCart) return null;

    return const TextStyle(
      color: Colors.black54,
      decoration: TextDecoration.lineThrough,
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListTile(
      onTap: () {
        onCartChanged(product, inCart);
      },
      leading: CircleAvatar(
        backgroundColor: _getColor(context),
        child: Text(product.name[0]),
      ),
      title: Text(product.name, style: _getTextStyle(context)),
    );
  }
}

class ShoppingList extends StatefulWidget {
  const ShoppingList({required this.products, super.key});

  final List<Product> products;

  // The framework calls createState the first time
  // a widget appears at a given location in the tree.
  // If the parent rebuilds and uses the same type of
  // widget (with the same key), the framework re-uses
  // the State object instead of creating a new State object.

  @override
  State<ShoppingList> createState() => _ShoppingListState();
}

class _ShoppingListState extends State<ShoppingList> {
  final _shoppingCart = <Product>{};

  void _handleCartChanged(Product product, bool inCart) {
    setState(() {
      // When a user changes what's in the cart, you need
      // to change _shoppingCart inside a setState call to
      // trigger a rebuild.
      // The framework then calls build, below,
      // which updates the visual appearance of the app.

      if (!inCart) {
        _shoppingCart.add(product);
      } else {
        _shoppingCart.remove(product);
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Shopping List')),
      body: ListView(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 8),
        children:
            widget.products.map((product) {
              return ShoppingListItem(
                product: product,
                inCart: _shoppingCart.contains(product),
                onCartChanged: _handleCartChanged,
              );
            }).toList(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    const MaterialApp(
      title: 'Shopping App',
      home: ShoppingList(
        products: [
          Product(name: 'Eggs'),
          Product(name: 'Flour'),
          Product(name: 'Chocolate chips'),
        ],
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

The `ShoppingList` class extends [`StatefulWidget`][],
which means this widget stores mutable state.
When the `ShoppingList` widget is first inserted
into the tree, the framework calls the [`createState()`][] function
to create a fresh instance of `_ShoppingListState` to associate with that
location in the tree. (Notice that subclasses of
[`State`][] are typically named with leading underscores to
indicate that they are private implementation details.)
When this widget's parent rebuilds, the parent creates a new instance
of `ShoppingList`, but the framework reuses the `_ShoppingListState`
instance that is already in the tree rather than calling
`createState` again.

To access properties of the current `ShoppingList`,
the `_ShoppingListState` can use its [`widget`][] property.
If the parent rebuilds and creates a new `ShoppingList`,
the `_ShoppingListState` rebuilds with the new widget value.
If you wish to be notified when the `widget` property changes,
override the [`didUpdateWidget()`][] function, which is passed
an `oldWidget` to let you compare the old widget with
the current widget.

When handling the `onCartChanged` callback, the `_ShoppingListState`
mutates its internal state by either adding or removing a product from
`_shoppingCart`. To signal to the framework that it changed its internal
state, it wraps those calls in a [`setState()`][] call.
Calling `setState` marks this widget as dirty and schedules it to be rebuilt
the next time your app needs to update the screen.
If you forget to call `setState` when modifying the internal
state of a widget, the framework won't know your widget is
dirty and might not call the widget's [`build()`][] function,
which means the user interface might not update to reflect
the changed state.  By managing state in this way,
you don't need to write separate code for creating and
updating child widgets. Instead, you simply implement the `build`
function, which handles both situations.

## Responding to widget lifecycle events

After calling [`createState()`][] on the `StatefulWidget`,
the framework inserts the new state object into the tree and
then calls [`initState()`][] on the state object.
A subclass of [`State`][] can override `initState` to do work
that needs to happen just once. For example, override `initState`
to configure animations or to subscribe to platform services.
Implementations of `initState` are required to start
by calling `super.initState`.

When a state object is no longer needed,
the framework calls [`dispose()`][] on the state object.
Override the `dispose` function to do cleanup work.
For example, override `dispose` to cancel timers or to
unsubscribe from platform services. Implementations of
`dispose` typically end by calling `super.dispose`.

For more information, check out [`State`][].

## Keys

Use keys to control which widgets the framework matches up
with other widgets when a widget rebuilds. By default, the
framework matches widgets in the current and previous build
according to their [`runtimeType`][] and the order in which they appear.
With keys, the framework requires that the two widgets have
the same [`key`][] as well as the same `runtimeType`.

Keys are most useful in widgets that build many instances of
the same type of widget. For example, the `ShoppingList` widget,
which builds just enough `ShoppingListItem` instances to
fill its visible region:

 * Without keys, the first entry in the current build
   would always sync with the first entry in the previous build,
   even if, semantically, the first entry in the list just
   scrolled off screen and is no longer visible in the viewport.

 * By assigning each entry in the list a "semantic" key,
   the infinite list can be more efficient because the
   framework syncs entries with matching semantic keys
   and therefore similar (or identical) visual appearances.
   Moreover, syncing the entries semantically means that
   state retained in stateful child widgets remains attached
   to the same semantic entry rather than the entry in the
   same numerical position in the viewport.

For more information, check out the [`Key`][] API.

## Global keys

Use global keys to uniquely identify child widgets.
Global keys must be globally unique across the entire
widget hierarchy, unlike local keys which need
only be unique among siblings. Because they are
globally unique, a global key can be used to
retrieve the state associated with a widget.

For more information, check out the [`GlobalKey`][] API.
