The sidenav presents the overall information architecture for the site
and provides developers access to documentation by topic.

The contents of the sidenav are configured in
the `/src/_data/sidenav.yml` file in [YAML][] format.

[YAML]: https://yaml.org/

## Add a page

## Remove a page

## Hide pages unless open

## Icons for top-level sections

Top-level section entries support an optional `icon` field to render a Material Symbols icon to the left of the section title. Use the icon's identifier (for example, `flag`, `download`, or `build`). This icon appears only for the first-level items.

Icons use the site's Material Symbols font. Choose identifiers from Google's [Material Symbols catalog](https://fonts.google.com/icons).
