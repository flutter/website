## Develop with Flutter

Even just using Flutter and providing feedback is a valuable contribution!

### Provide feedback

Sharing your feedback and experiences helps the Flutter team
understand and prioritize developer needs and pain points.

You can provide valuable feedback through many avenues, including:

- Upvoting existing issues

  If you're experiencing an issue that has already been reported,
  consider upvoting it to help the Flutter team understand its importance.

  Avoid otherwise empty thumbs up, +1, or similar comments.
  However, if you have additional information,
  such as reproduction steps or additional version information,
  do consider providing those details in a new comment.
- Reporting new bugs

  If you experience a bug with Flutter that hasn't yet been reported,
  do [open a new issue][] with reproduction information.
- Requesting features

  If there's a feature you think Flutter should add or implement
  but hasn't yet been suggested, do [open a new issue][] with
  all relevant information as well as your use case.
- Partaking in surveys

  Occasionally, the Flutter team will run developer surveys and studies.
  To help understand pain points and improve the Flutter developer experience,
  consider responding with as much feedback and details as possible.

  To sign up for future UX research studies,
  visit [flutter.dev/research-signup][uxr-signup].
- Discussing proposals

  Major changes to Flutter are often discussed through [design documents][].
  Consider reading and providing feedback on proposals that are
  relevant to you or your apps.

  To find current design docs and proposals,
  check out [issues with the `design doc` label][design-doc-issues] on
  the GitHub issue database.
- Reviewing pull requests

  If you're familiar with a particular area of Flutter
  or a solution to a particular issue is important to you,
  consider reviewing open pull requests, trying them with your app,
  and providing any relevant feedback.

[open a new issue]: {{site.repo.flutter}}/issues/new
[uxr-signup]: {{site.main-url}}/research-signup
[design documents]: {{site.repo.flutter}}/blob/main/docs/contributing/Design-Documents.md
[design-doc-issues]: {{site.repo.flutter}}/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22design+doc%22

### Try out the beta channel

To help ensure Flutter's stability and improve upcoming features,
help test upcoming releases before they reach the stable channel.

Consider testing releases on the `beta` channel,
both for general development and for testing compatibility with your apps.

Any feedback you have or regressions you encounter,
make sure to [report them][report-bugs] to the Flutter team.

To get started,
[switch][switch-channels] to the [`beta` channel][beta-channel] today
and account for any [necessary migrations][].

[switch-channels]: /install/upgrade#change-channels
[beta-channel]: /install/upgrade#the-beta-channel
[report-bugs]: {{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/issues/new/choose
[necessary migrations]: /release/breaking-changes

## Write documentation

Contributing to Flutter documentation, no matter the form,
is one of the most impactful ways you can help Flutter.

### Flutter API docs

The API docs are heavily relied on by many Flutter developers,
both online and in their code editors.

Whether you're interested in writing new docs, updating existing ones,
adding relevant code snippets, or even creating new visuals like diagrams,
your contribution to the API docs will be
appreciated by every Flutter developer.

To get started, check out
the [Flutter SDK contribution guide][flutter-contribute],
particularly its section on [API documentation][flutter-api-contribute]

[flutter-contribute]: {{site.repo.flutter}}/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
[flutter-api-contribute]: {{site.repo.flutter}}/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#api-documentation

### Documentation website

Consider contributing to this very site,
guiding developers as they learn and explore Flutter.

To learn about contributing to the Flutter documentation website,
check out the website's [contribution documentation][website-contribute].

You can also contribute to the [Dart website][],
enhancing the documentation for the client-optimized language
that forms the foundation of Flutter.
To learn how to contribute,
check out the [`dart-lang/site-www` contribution docs][dart-dev-contribute].

[issue hygiene]: {{site.repo.flutter}}/tree/main/docs/contributing/issue_hygiene

## Strengthen the package ecosystem

Help grow and support the collection of
available Dart and Flutter packages on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/).

### Contribute to packages you use

To give back to packages you depend on and potentially even help your own apps,
find packages you rely on and contribute back to them.

To contribute to a package,
navigate to its page on the [pub.dev site][]
and find the repository linked in the page's sidenav.

Before contributing, do make sure to
follow each package's contribution guide,
discuss your contribution with the maintainers, and
keep in mind Flutter's [Code of conduct][].

[pub.dev site]: {{site.pub}}
[Code of conduct]: {{site.repo.flutter}}/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

### Open source reusable functionality from your app

If you've built a cool, generic widget or utility in your app,
consider extracting it into a package and publishing it to pub.dev.

To get started, learn about
[Creating Dart packages][] and [Developing Flutter packages][].
Then, when you're ready to publish your package to the [pub.dev site][],
follow the guide and best practices on [Publishing packages][].

[Creating Dart packages]: {{site.dart-site}}/tools/pub/create-packages
[Developing Flutter packages]: /packages-and-plugins/developing-packages
[pub.dev site]: {{site.pub}}
[Publishing packages]: {{site.dart-site}}/tools/pub/publishing

### Add Dart or Flutter support to popular SDKs

Create or contribute to packages that wrap native SDKs or web APIs.

Before creating a new package,
first try to find any existing wrappers that you
could use or contribute to on the [pub.dev site][].

Depending on the SDK and platform,
you might need to [Write platform-specific code][],
use [JS interop][], wrap a REST API using [`package:http`][],
or reimplement the required functionality in Dart.

If you're planning to create a new package, learn about
[Creating Dart packages][] and [Developing Flutter packages][].
Then, when you're ready to publish your package to the [pub.dev site][],
follow the guide and best practices on [Publishing packages][].

[pub.dev site]: {{site.pub}}
[Write platform-specific code]: /platform-integration/platform-channels
[JS interop]: {{site.dart-site}}/interop/js-interop
[`package:http`]: {{site.pub-pkg}}/http
