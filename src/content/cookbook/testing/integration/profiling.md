<?code-excerpt path-base="cookbook/testing/integration/profiling/"?>

When it comes to mobile apps, performance is critical to user experience.
Users expect apps to have smooth scrolling and meaningful animations free of
stuttering or skipped frames, known as "jank." How to ensure that your app
is free of jank on a wide variety of devices?

There are two options: first, manually test the app on different devices.
While that approach might work for a smaller app, it becomes more
cumbersome as an app grows in size. Alternatively, run an integration
test that performs a specific task and records a performance timeline.
Then, examine the results to determine whether a specific section of
the app needs to be improved.

In this recipe, learn how to write a test that records a performance
timeline while performing a specific task and saves a summary of the
results to a local file.

:::note
Recording performance timelines isn't supported on web.
For performance profiling on web, see
[Debugging performance for web apps][]
:::

This recipe uses the following steps:

  1. Write a test that scrolls through a list of items.
  2. Record the performance of the app.
  3. Save the results to disk.
  4. Run the test.
  5. Review the results.

## 1. Write a test that scrolls through a list of items

In this recipe, record the performance of an app as it scrolls through a
list of items. To focus on performance profiling, this recipe builds
on the [Scrolling][] recipe in widget tests.

Follow the instructions in that recipe to create an app and write a test to
verify that everything works as expected.

## 2. Record the performance of the app

Next, record the performance of the app as it scrolls through the
list. Perform this task using the [`traceAction()`][]
method provided by the [`IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding`][] class.

This method runs the provided function and records a [`Timeline`][]
with detailed information about the performance of the app. This example
provides a function that scrolls through the list of items,
ensuring that a specific item is displayed. When the function completes,
the `traceAction()` creates a report data `Map` that contains the `Timeline`.

Specify the `reportKey` when running more than one `traceAction`.
By default all `Timelines` are stored with the key `timeline`,
in this example the `reportKey` is changed to `scrolling_timeline`.

<?code-excerpt "integration_test/scrolling_test.dart (traceAction)"?>
```dart
await binding.traceAction(
  () async {
    // Scroll until the item to be found appears.
    await tester.scrollUntilVisible(
      itemFinder,
      500.0,
      scrollable: listFinder,
    );
  },
  reportKey: 'scrolling_timeline',
);
```

## 3. Save the results to disk

Now that you've captured a performance timeline, you need a way to review it.
The `Timeline` object provides detailed information about all of the events
that took place, but it doesn't provide a convenient way to review the results.

Therefore, convert the `Timeline` into a [`TimelineSummary`][].
The `TimelineSummary` can perform two tasks that make it easier
to review the results:

  1. Writing a json document on disk that summarizes the data contained
     within the `Timeline`. This summary includes information about the
     number of skipped frames, slowest build times, and more.
  2. Saving the complete `Timeline` as a json file on disk.
     This file can be opened with the Chrome browser's
     tracing tools found at `chrome://tracing`.

To capture the results, create a file named `perf_driver.dart`
in the `test_driver` folder and add the following code:

<?code-excerpt "test_driver/perf_driver.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter_driver/flutter_driver.dart' as driver;
import 'package:integration_test/integration_test_driver.dart';

Future<void> main() {
  return integrationDriver(
    responseDataCallback: (data) async {
      if (data != null) {
        final timeline = driver.Timeline.fromJson(
          data['scrolling_timeline'] as Map<String, dynamic>,
        );

        // Convert the Timeline into a TimelineSummary that's easier to
        // read and understand.
        final summary = driver.TimelineSummary.summarize(timeline);

        // Then, write the entire timeline to disk in a json format.
        // This file can be opened in the Chrome browser's tracing tools
        // found by navigating to chrome://tracing.
        // Optionally, save the summary to disk by setting includeSummary
        // to true
        await summary.writeTimelineToFile(
          'scrolling_timeline',
          pretty: true,
          includeSummary: true,
        );
      }
    },
  );
}
```

The `integrationDriver` function has a `responseDataCallback` 
which you can customize. 
By default, it writes the results to the `integration_response_data.json` file,
but you can customize it to generate a summary like in this example.

## 4. Run the test

After configuring the test to capture a performance `Timeline` and save a
summary of the results to disk, run the test with the following command:

```console
flutter drive \
  --driver=test_driver/perf_driver.dart \
  --target=integration_test/scrolling_test.dart \
  --profile
```

The `--profile` option means to compile the app for the "profile mode" 
rather than the "debug mode", so that the benchmark result is closer to 
what will be experienced by end users. 

:::note
Run the command with `--no-dds` when running on a mobile device or emulator.
This option disables the Dart Development Service (DDS), which won't
be accessible from your computer.
:::

## 5. Review the results

After the test completes successfully, the `build` directory at the root of
the project contains two files:

  1. `scrolling_summary.timeline_summary.json` contains the summary. Open
     the file with any text editor to review the information contained
     within.  With a more advanced setup, you could save a summary every
     time the test runs and create a graph of the results.
  2. `scrolling_timeline.timeline.json` contains the complete timeline data.
     Open the file using the Chrome browser's tracing tools found at
     `chrome://tracing`. The tracing tools provide a
     convenient interface for inspecting the timeline data to discover
     the source of a performance issue.

### Summary example

```json
{
  "average_frame_build_time_millis": 4.2592592592592595,
  "worst_frame_build_time_millis": 21.0,
  "missed_frame_build_budget_count": 2,
  "average_frame_rasterizer_time_millis": 5.518518518518518,
  "worst_frame_rasterizer_time_millis": 51.0,
  "missed_frame_rasterizer_budget_count": 10,
  "frame_count": 54,
  "frame_build_times": [
    6874,
    5019,
    3638
  ],
  "frame_rasterizer_times": [
    51955,
    8468,
    3129
  ]
}
```
