In the [introduction to unit testing][] recipe,
you learned how to test Dart classes using the `test` package.
To test widget classes, you need a few additional tools provided by the
[`flutter_test`][] package, which ships with the Flutter SDK.

The `flutter_test` package provides the following tools for
testing widgets:

  * The [`WidgetTester`][] allows building and interacting
    with widgets in a test environment.
  * The [`testWidgets()`][] function automatically
    creates a new `WidgetTester` for each test case,
    and is used in place of the normal `test()` function.
  * The [`Finder`][] classes allow searching for widgets
    in the test environment.
  * Widget-specific [`Matcher`][] constants help verify
   whether a `Finder` locates a widget or
    multiple widgets in the test environment.

If this sounds overwhelming, don't worry. Learn how all of these pieces fit
together throughout this recipe, which uses the following steps:

  1. Add the `flutter_test` dependency.
  2. Create a widget to test.
  3. Create a `testWidgets` test.
  4. Build the widget using the `WidgetTester`.
  5. Search for the widget using a `Finder`.
  6. Verify the widget using a `Matcher`.

## 1. Add the `flutter_test` dependency

Before writing tests, include the `flutter_test`
dependency in the `dev_dependencies` section of the `pubspec.yaml` file.
If creating a new Flutter project with the command line tools or
a code editor, this dependency should already be in place.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
```

## 2. Create a widget to test

Next, create a widget for testing. For this recipe,
create a widget that displays a `title` and `message`.

<?code-excerpt "test/main_test.dart (widget)"?>
```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key, required this.title, required this.message});

  final String title;
  final String message;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text(title)),
        body: Center(child: Text(message)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## 3. Create a `testWidgets` test

With a widget to test, begin by writing your first test.
Use the [`testWidgets()`][] function provided by the
`flutter_test` package to define a test.
The `testWidgets` function allows you to define a
widget test and creates a `WidgetTester` to work with.

This test verifies that `MyWidget` displays a given title and message.
It is titled accordingly, and it will be populated in the next section.

<?code-excerpt "test/main_step3_test.dart (main)"?>
```dart
void main() {
  // Define a test. The TestWidgets function also provides a WidgetTester
  // to work with. The WidgetTester allows you to build and interact
  // with widgets in the test environment.
  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (tester) async {
    // Test code goes here.
  });
}
```

## 4. Build the widget using the `WidgetTester`

Next, build `MyWidget` inside the test environment by using the
[`pumpWidget()`][] method provided by `WidgetTester`.
The `pumpWidget` method builds and renders the provided widget.

Create a `MyWidget` instance that displays "T" as the title
and "M" as the message.

<?code-excerpt "test/main_step4_test.dart (main)"?>
```dart
void main() {
  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (tester) async {
    // Create the widget by telling the tester to build it.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyWidget(title: 'T', message: 'M'));
  });
}
```

### Notes about the pump() methods

After the initial call to `pumpWidget()`, the `WidgetTester` provides
additional ways to rebuild the same widget. This is useful if you're
working with a `StatefulWidget` or animations.

For example, tapping a button calls `setState()`, but Flutter won't
automatically rebuild your widget in the test environment.
Use one of the following methods to ask Flutter to rebuild the widget.

[`tester.pump(Duration duration)`][]
: Schedules a frame and triggers a rebuild of the widget.
  If a `Duration` is specified, it advances the clock by
  that amount and schedules a frame. It does not schedule
  multiple frames even if the duration is longer than a
  single frame.

:::note
To kick off the animation, you need to call `pump()`
once (with no duration specified) to start the ticker.
Without it, the animation does not start.
:::

[`tester.pumpAndSettle()`][]
: Repeatedly calls `pump()` with the given duration until
  there are no longer any frames scheduled.
  This, essentially, waits for all animations to complete.

These methods provide fine-grained control over the build lifecycle,
which is particularly useful while testing.

## 5. Search for our widget using a `Finder`

With a widget in the test environment, search
through the widget tree for the `title` and `message`
Text widgets using a `Finder`. This allows verification that
the widgets are being displayed correctly.

For this purpose, use the top-level [`find()`][]
method provided by the `flutter_test` package to create the `Finders`.
Since you know you're looking for `Text` widgets, use the
[`find.text()`][] method.

For more information about `Finder` classes, see the
[Finding widgets in a widget test][] recipe.

<?code-excerpt "test/main_step5_test.dart (main)"?>
```dart
void main() {
  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyWidget(title: 'T', message: 'M'));

    // Create the Finders.
    final titleFinder = find.text('T');
    final messageFinder = find.text('M');
  });
}
```

## 6. Verify the widget using a `Matcher`

Finally, verify the title and message `Text` widgets appear on screen
using the `Matcher` constants provided by `flutter_test`.
`Matcher` classes are a core part of the `test` package,
and provide a common way to verify a given
value meets expectations.

Ensure that the widgets appear on screen exactly one time.
For this purpose, use the [`findsOneWidget`][] `Matcher`.

<?code-excerpt "test/main_step6_test.dart (main)"?>
```dart
void main() {
  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyWidget(title: 'T', message: 'M'));
    final titleFinder = find.text('T');
    final messageFinder = find.text('M');

    // Use the `findsOneWidget` matcher provided by flutter_test to verify
    // that the Text widgets appear exactly once in the widget tree.
    expect(titleFinder, findsOneWidget);
    expect(messageFinder, findsOneWidget);
  });
}
```

### Additional Matchers

In addition to `findsOneWidget`, `flutter_test` provides additional
matchers for common cases.

[`findsNothing`][]
: Verifies that no widgets are found.

[`findsWidgets`][]
: Verifies that one or more widgets are found.

[`findsNWidgets`][]
: Verifies that a specific number of widgets are found.

[`matchesGoldenFile`][]
: Verifies that a widget's rendering matches a particular bitmap image ("golden file" testing).

## Complete example

<?code-excerpt "test/main_test.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

void main() {
  // Define a test. The TestWidgets function also provides a WidgetTester
  // to work with. The WidgetTester allows building and interacting
  // with widgets in the test environment.
  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (tester) async {
    // Create the widget by telling the tester to build it.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyWidget(title: 'T', message: 'M'));

    // Create the Finders.
    final titleFinder = find.text('T');
    final messageFinder = find.text('M');

    // Use the `findsOneWidget` matcher provided by flutter_test to
    // verify that the Text widgets appear exactly once in the widget tree.
    expect(titleFinder, findsOneWidget);
    expect(messageFinder, findsOneWidget);
  });
}

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key, required this.title, required this.message});

  final String title;
  final String message;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: Text(title)),
        body: Center(child: Text(message)),
      ),
    );
  }
}
