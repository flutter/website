  This partly duplicates the AdMob documentation
  here: https://developers.google.com/admob/flutter/quick-start
  
  The added value of this page is that it's more straightforward for
  someone who just has a Flutter app or game and wants to add
  monetization to it.
  
  In short, this is a friendlier --- though not as comprehensive ---
  introduction to ads in Flutter.
{% endcomment %}


Many developers use advertising to monetize their mobile apps and games.
This allows their app to be downloaded free of charge, 
which improves the app's popularity.

![An illustration of a smartphone showing an ad](/assets/images/docs/cookbook/ads-device.jpg){:.site-illustration}

To add ads to your Flutter project, use
[AdMob](https://admob.google.com/home/), 
Google's mobile advertising platform.
This recipe demonstrates how to use the
[`google_mobile_ads`]({{site.pub-pkg}}/google_mobile_ads)
package to add a banner ad to your app or game.

:::note
Apart from AdMob, the `google_mobile_ads` package also supports
Ad Manager, a platform intended for large publishers. Integrating Ad
Manager resembles integrating AdMob, but it won't be covered in this
cookbook recipe. To use Ad Manager, follow the
[Ad Manager documentation]({{site.developers}}/ad-manager/mobile-ads-sdk/flutter/quick-start).
:::

## 1. Get AdMob App IDs

1.  Go to [AdMob](https://admob.google.com/) and set up an
    account. This could take some time because you need to provide
    banking information, sign contracts, and so on.

2.  With the AdMob account ready, create two *Apps* in AdMob: one for
    Android and one for iOS.

3.  Open the **App settings** section.

4.  Get the AdMob *App IDs* for both the Android app and the iOS app.
    They resemble `ca-app-pub-1234567890123456~1234567890`. Note the
    tilde (`~`) between the two numbers.

## 2. Platform-specific setup

Update your Android and iOS configurations to include your App IDs.

{% endcomment %}

### Android

Add your AdMob app ID to your Android app.

1.  Open the app's `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file.

2.  Add a new `<meta-data>` tag.

3.  Set the `android:name` element with a value of
    `com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID`.

4.  Set the `android:value` element with the value to your own AdMob app
    ID that you got in the previous step. 
    Include them in quotes as shown:

    ```xml
    <manifest>
        <application>
            ...
    
            <!-- Sample AdMob app ID: ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713 -->
            <meta-data
                android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
                android:value="ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx~yyyyyyyyyy"/>
        </application>
    </manifest>
    ```

### iOS

Add your AdMob app ID to your iOS app.

1.  Open your app's `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.

2.  Enclose `GADApplicationIdentifier` with a `key` tag.

3.  Enclose your AdMob app ID with a `string` tag. You created this AdMob
    App ID in [step 1](#1-get-admob-app-ids).

    ```xml
    <key>GADApplicationIdentifier</key>
    <string>ca-app-pub-################~##########</string>
    ```

## 3. Add the `google_mobile_ads` plugin

To add the `google_mobile_ads` plugin as a dependency, run
`flutter pub add`:

```console
$ flutter pub add google_mobile_ads
```

:::note
Once you add the plugin, your Android app might fail to build with a
`DexArchiveMergerException`:

```plaintext
Error while merging dex archives:
The number of method references in a .dex file cannot exceed 64K.
```

To resolve this, execute the `flutter run` command in the terminal, not
through an IDE plugin. The `flutter` tool can detect the issue and ask
whether it should try to solve it. Answer `y`, and the problem goes away.
You can return to running your app from an IDE after that.

:::

## 4. Initialize the Mobile Ads SDK

You need to initialize the Mobile Ads SDK before loading ads.

1.  Call `MobileAds.instance.initialize()` to initialize the Mobile Ads
    SDK.

    <?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (main)"?>
    ```dart
    void main() async {
      WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
      unawaited(MobileAds.instance.initialize());
    
      runApp(const MyApp());
    }
    ```

Run the initialization step at startup, as shown above, 
so that the AdMob SDK has enough time to initialize before it is needed.

:::note
`MobileAds.instance.initialize()` returns a `Future` but, the
way the SDK is built, you don't need to `await` it.
If you try to load an ad before that `Future` is completed, 
the SDK will gracefully wait until the initialization, and _then_ load the ad.
You can await the `Future`
if you want to know the exact time when the AdMob SDK is ready.
:::

## 5. Load a banner ad

To show an ad, you need to request it from AdMob.

To load a banner ad, construct a `BannerAd` instance, and
call `load()` on it.

:::note
The following code snippet refers to fields such a `adSize`, `adUnitId`
and `_bannerAd`. This will all make more sense in a later step.
:::

<?code-excerpt "lib/my_banner_ad.dart (loadAd)"?>
```dart
/// Loads a banner ad.
void _loadAd() {
  final bannerAd = BannerAd(
    size: widget.adSize,
    adUnitId: widget.adUnitId,
    request: const AdRequest(),
    listener: BannerAdListener(
      // Called when an ad is successfully received.
      onAdLoaded: (ad) {
        if (!mounted) {
          ad.dispose();
          return;
        }
        setState(() {
          _bannerAd = ad as BannerAd;
        });
      },
      // Called when an ad request failed.
      onAdFailedToLoad: (ad, error) {
        debugPrint('BannerAd failed to load: $error');
        ad.dispose();
      },
    ),
  );

  // Start loading.
  bannerAd.load();
}
```

To view a complete example, check out the last step of this recipe.


## 6. Show banner ad

Once you have a loaded instance of `BannerAd`, use `AdWidget` to show it.

```dart
AdWidget(ad: _bannerAd)
```

It's a good idea to wrap the widget in a `SafeArea` (so that no part of
the ad is obstructed by device notches) and a `SizedBox` (so that it has
its specified, constant size before and after loading).

<?code-excerpt "lib/my_banner_ad.dart (build)"?>
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return SafeArea(
    child: SizedBox(
      width: widget.adSize.width.toDouble(),
      height: widget.adSize.height.toDouble(),
      child: _bannerAd == null
          // Nothing to render yet.
          ? const SizedBox()
          // The actual ad.
          : AdWidget(ad: _bannerAd!),
    ),
  );
}
```

You must dispose of an ad when you no longer need to access it. The best
practice for when to call `dispose()` is either after the `AdWidget` is
removed from the widget tree or in the
`BannerAdListener.onAdFailedToLoad()` callback.

<?code-excerpt "lib/my_banner_ad.dart (dispose)"?>
```dart
_bannerAd?.dispose();
```


## 7. Configure ads

To show anything beyond test ads, you have to register ad units.

1.  Open [AdMob](https://admob.google.com/).

2.  Create an *Ad unit* for each of the AdMob apps.

    ![Screenshot of the location of Ad Units in AdMob web UI](/assets/images/docs/cookbook/ads-ad-unit.png)

    This asks for the Ad unit's format. AdMob provides many formats
    beyond banner ads --- interstitials, rewarded ads, app open ads, and
    so on. 
    The API for those is similar, and documented in the 
    [AdMob documentation]({{site.developers}}/admob/flutter/quick-start)
    and through 
    [official samples](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-mobile-flutter/tree/main/samples/admob).

3.  Choose banner ads.

4.  Get the *Ad unit IDs* for both the Android app and the iOS app.
    You can find these in the **Ad units** section. They look something
    like `ca-app-pub-1234567890123456/1234567890`. The format resembles
    the *App ID* but with a slash (`/`) between the two numbers. This
    distinguishes an *Ad unit ID* from an *App ID*.

    ![Screenshot of an Ad Unit ID in AdMob web UI](/assets/images/docs/cookbook/ads-ad-unit-id.png)

5.  Add these *Ad unit IDs* to the constructor of `BannerAd`,
    depending on the target app platform.

    <?code-excerpt "lib/my_banner_ad.dart (adUnitId)"?>
    ```dart
    final String adUnitId = Platform.isAndroid
        // Use this ad unit on Android...
        ? 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111'
        // ... or this one on iOS.
        : 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2934735716';
    ```

## 8. Final touches

To display the ads in a published app or game (as opposed to debug or
testing scenarios), your app must meet additional requirements:

1.  Your app must be reviewed and approved before it can fully serve
    ads.
    Follow AdMob's [app readiness guidelines](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/10564477).
    For example, your app must be listed on at least one of the
    supported stores such as Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

2.  You must [create an `app-ads.txt`](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9363762)
    file and publish it on your developer website.

## 9. Complete example

The following code implements a simple stateful widget that loads a
banner ad and shows it.

<?code-excerpt "lib/my_banner_ad.dart"?>
```dart
import 'dart:io';

import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:google_mobile_ads/google_mobile_ads.dart';

class MyBannerAdWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  /// The requested size of the banner. Defaults to [AdSize.banner].
  final AdSize adSize;

  /// The AdMob ad unit to show.
  ///
  /// TODO: replace this test ad unit with your own ad unit
  final String adUnitId = Platform.isAndroid
      // Use this ad unit on Android...
      ? 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/6300978111'
      // ... or this one on iOS.
      : 'ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2934735716';

  MyBannerAdWidget({
    super.key,
    this.adSize = AdSize.banner,
  });

  @override
  State<MyBannerAdWidget> createState() => _MyBannerAdWidgetState();
}

class _MyBannerAdWidgetState extends State<MyBannerAdWidget> {
  /// The banner ad to show. This is `null` until the ad is actually loaded.
  BannerAd? _bannerAd;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SafeArea(
      child: SizedBox(
        width: widget.adSize.width.toDouble(),
        height: widget.adSize.height.toDouble(),
        child: _bannerAd == null
            // Nothing to render yet.
            ? const SizedBox()
            // The actual ad.
            : AdWidget(ad: _bannerAd!),
      ),
    );
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadAd();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _bannerAd?.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  /// Loads a banner ad.
  void _loadAd() {
    final bannerAd = BannerAd(
      size: widget.adSize,
      adUnitId: widget.adUnitId,
      request: const AdRequest(),
      listener: BannerAdListener(
        // Called when an ad is successfully received.
        onAdLoaded: (ad) {
          if (!mounted) {
            ad.dispose();
            return;
          }
          setState(() {
            _bannerAd = ad as BannerAd;
          });
        },
        // Called when an ad request failed.
        onAdFailedToLoad: (ad, error) {
          debugPrint('BannerAd failed to load: $error');
          ad.dispose();
        },
      ),
    );

    // Start loading.
    bannerAd.load();
  }
}
```

:::tip
In many cases, you will want to load the ad _outside_ a widget.

For example, you can load it in a `ChangeNotifier`, a BLoC, a controller,
or whatever else you are using for app-level state. This way, you can
preload a banner ad in advance, and have it ready to show for when the
user navigates to a new screen.

Verify that you have loaded the `BannerAd` instance before showing it with
an `AdWidget`, and that you dispose of the instance when it is no longer
needed.
