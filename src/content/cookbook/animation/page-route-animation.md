A design language, such as Material, defines standard behaviors when
transitioning between routes (or screens). Sometimes, though, a custom
transition between screens can make an app more unique. To help,
[`PageRouteBuilder`][] provides an [`Animation`] object.
This `Animation` can be used with [`Tween`][] and
[`Curve`][] objects to customize the transition animation.
This recipe shows how to transition between
routes by animating the new route into view from
the bottom of the screen.

To create a custom page route transition, this recipe uses the following steps:

1. Set up a PageRouteBuilder
2. Create a `Tween`
3. Add an `AnimatedWidget`
4. Use a `CurveTween`
5. Combine the two `Tween`s

## 1. Set up a PageRouteBuilder

To start, use a [`PageRouteBuilder`][] to create a [`Route`][].
`PageRouteBuilder` has two callbacks, one to build the content of the route
(`pageBuilder`), and one to build the route's transition (`transitionsBuilder`).

:::note
The `child` parameter in transitionsBuilder is the widget returned from
pageBuilder. The `pageBuilder` function is only called the first time the
route is built. The framework can avoid extra work because `child` stays the
same throughout the transition.
:::

The following example creates two routes: a home route with a "Go!" button, and
a second route titled "Page 2".

<?code-excerpt "lib/starter.dart (Starter)"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    const MaterialApp(
      home: Page1(),
    ),
  );
}

class Page1 extends StatelessWidget {
  const Page1({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(context).push(_createRoute());
          },
          child: const Text('Go!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

Route _createRoute() {
  return PageRouteBuilder(
    pageBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation) => const Page2(),
    transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation, child) {
      return child;
    },
  );
}

class Page2 extends StatelessWidget {
  const Page2({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(),
      body: const Center(
        child: Text('Page 2'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## 2. Create a Tween

To make the new page animate in from the bottom, it should animate from
`Offset(0,1)` to `Offset(0, 0)` (usually defined using the `Offset.zero`
constructor). In this case, the Offset is a 2D vector for the
['FractionalTranslation'][] widget.
Setting the `dy` argument to 1 represents a vertical translation one
full height of the page.

The `transitionsBuilder` callback has an `animation` parameter. It's an
`Animation<double>` that produces values between 0 and 1. Convert the
`Animation<double>` into an `Animation<Offset>` using a Tween:

<?code-excerpt "lib/starter.dart (step1)"?>
```dart
transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation, child) {
  const begin = Offset(0.0, 1.0);
  const end = Offset.zero;
  final tween = Tween(begin: begin, end: end);
  final offsetAnimation = animation.drive(tween);
  return child;
},
```

## 3. Use an AnimatedWidget

Flutter has a set of widgets extending [`AnimatedWidget`][]
that rebuild themselves when the value of the animation changes. For instance,
SlideTransition takes an `Animation<Offset>` and translates its child (using a
FractionalTranslation widget) whenever the value of the animation changes.

AnimatedWidget Return a [`SlideTransition`][]
with the `Animation<Offset>` and the child widget:

<?code-excerpt "lib/starter.dart (step2)"?>
```dart
transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation, child) {
  const begin = Offset(0.0, 1.0);
  const end = Offset.zero;
  final tween = Tween(begin: begin, end: end);
  final offsetAnimation = animation.drive(tween);

  return SlideTransition(
    position: offsetAnimation,
    child: child,
  );
},
```

## 4. Use a CurveTween

Flutter provides a selection of easing curves that
adjust the rate of the animation over time.
The [`Curves`][] class
provides a predefined set of commonly used curves.
For example, `Curves.easeOut`
makes the animation start quickly and end slowly.

To use a Curve, create a new [`CurveTween`][]
and pass it a Curve:

<?code-excerpt "lib/starter.dart (step3)"?>
```dart
var curve = Curves.ease;
var curveTween = CurveTween(curve: curve);
```

This new Tween still produces values from 0 to 1. In the next step, it will be
combined the `Tween<Offset>` from step 2.

## 5. Combine the two Tweens

To combine the tweens,
use [`chain()`][]:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (Tween)"?>
```dart
const begin = Offset(0.0, 1.0);
const end = Offset.zero;
const curve = Curves.ease;

var tween = Tween(begin: begin, end: end).chain(CurveTween(curve: curve));
```

Then use this tween by passing it to `animation.drive()`. This creates a new
`Animation<Offset>` that can be given to the `SlideTransition` widget:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (SlideTransition)"?>
```dart
return SlideTransition(
  position: animation.drive(tween),
  child: child,
);
```

This new Tween (or Animatable) produces `Offset` values by first evaluating the
`CurveTween`, then evaluating the `Tween<Offset>.` When the animation runs, the
values are computed in this order:

1. The animation (provided to the transitionsBuilder callback) produces values
   from 0 to 1.
2. The CurveTween maps those values to new values between 0 and 1 based on its
   curve.
3. The `Tween<Offset>` maps the `double` values to `Offset` values.

Another way to create an `Animation<Offset>` with an easing curve is to use a
`CurvedAnimation`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/starter.dart (step4)" replace="/^\},$/}/g"?>
```dart
transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation, child) {
  const begin = Offset(0.0, 1.0);
  const end = Offset.zero;
  const curve = Curves.ease;

  final tween = Tween(begin: begin, end: end);
  final curvedAnimation = CurvedAnimation(
    parent: animation,
    curve: curve,
  );

  return SlideTransition(
    position: tween.animate(curvedAnimation),
    child: child,
  );
}
```

## Interactive example

<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart"?>
```dartpad title="Flutter page routing hands-on example in DartPad" run="true"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    const MaterialApp(
      home: Page1(),
    ),
  );
}

class Page1 extends StatelessWidget {
  const Page1({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(context).push(_createRoute());
          },
          child: const Text('Go!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

Route _createRoute() {
  return PageRouteBuilder(
    pageBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation) => const Page2(),
    transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation, child) {
      const begin = Offset(0.0, 1.0);
      const end = Offset.zero;
      const curve = Curves.ease;

      var tween = Tween(begin: begin, end: end).chain(CurveTween(curve: curve));

      return SlideTransition(
        position: animation.drive(tween),
        child: child,
      );
    },
  );
}

class Page2 extends StatelessWidget {
  const Page2({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(),
      body: const Center(
        child: Text('Page 2'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
