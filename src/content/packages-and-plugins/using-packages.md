<?code-excerpt path-base="platform_integration/plugin_api_migration"?>

Flutter supports using shared packages contributed by other developers
to the Flutter and Dart ecosystems. This allows quickly building
an app without having to develop everything from scratch.

:::note Difference between packages and plugins
A plugin is a _type_ of
package&mdash;the full designation is _plugin package_,
which is generally shortened to _plugin_.

**Packages**
: At a minimum, a Dart package is a directory
  containing a `pubspec.yaml` file. Additionally,
  a package can contain dependencies
  (listed in the pubspec), Dart libraries, apps,
  resources, tests, images, fonts, and examples.
  The [pub.dev][] site lists many packages—developed by Google engineers
  and generous members of the Flutter and Dart community—
  that you can use in your app.

**Plugins**
: A plugin package is a special kind of package that makes
  platform functionality available to the app.
  Plugin packages can be written for Android (using Kotlin or Java),
  iOS (using Swift or Objective-C), web, macOS, Windows, Linux,
  or any combination thereof.
  For example, a plugin might provide Flutter apps
  with the ability to use a device's camera.

Existing packages enable many use cases—for example,
making network requests ([`http`][]),
navigation/route handling ([`go_router`][]),
integration with device APIs
([`url_launcher`][] and [`battery_plus`][]),
and using third-party platform SDKs like Firebase
([FlutterFire][]).

To write a new package, see [developing packages][].
To add assets, images, or fonts,
whether stored in files or packages,
see [Adding assets and images][].

## Using packages

The following section describes how to use
existing published packages.

### Searching for packages

Packages are published to [pub.dev][].

The [Flutter landing page][] on pub.dev displays
top packages that are compatible with Flutter
(those that declare dependencies generally compatible with Flutter),
and supports searching among all published packages.

The [Flutter Favorites][] page on pub.dev lists
the plugins and packages that have been identified as
packages you should first consider using when writing
your app. For more information on what it means to
be a Flutter Favorite, see the
[Flutter Favorites program][].

You can also browse the packages on pub.dev by filtering
on [Android][], [iOS][], [web][],
[Linux][], [Windows][], [macOS][],
or any combination thereof.

[Android]: {{site.pub-pkg}}?q=sdk%3Aflutter+platform%3Aandroid
[Flutter Favorites]: {{site.pub}}/flutter/favorites
[Flutter Favorites program]: /packages-and-plugins/favorites
[Flutter landing page]: {{site.pub}}/flutter
[Linux]: {{site.pub-pkgs}}?q=sdk%3Aflutter+platform%3Alinux
[iOS]: {{site.pub-pkg}}?q=sdk%3Aflutter+platform%3Aios
[macOS]: {{site.pub-pkg}}?q=sdk%3Aflutter+platform%3Amacos
[web]: {{site.pub-pkg}}?q=sdk%3Aflutter+platform%3Aweb
[Windows]: {{site.pub-pkg}}?q=sdk%3Aflutter+platform%3Awindows

### Adding a package dependency to an app using `flutter pub add`

To add the package `css_colors` to an app:

1. Use the [`pub add`][] command from inside the project directory
   * `flutter pub add css_colors`

1. Import it
   * Add a corresponding `import` statement in the Dart code.

1. Stop and restart the app, if necessary
   * If the package brings platform-specific code
     (Kotlin/Java for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS),
     that code must be built into your app.
     Hot reload and hot restart only update the Dart code,
     so a full restart of the app might be required to avoid
     errors like `MissingPluginException` when using the package.

[`pub add`]: {{site.dart-site}}/tools/pub/cmd/pub-add

### Adding a package dependency to an app

To add the package `css_colors` to an app:

1. Depend on it
   * Open the `pubspec.yaml` file located inside the app folder,
     and add `css_colors: ^1.0.0` under `dependencies`.

1. Install it
   * From the terminal: Run `flutter pub get`.<br/>
   **OR**
   * From VS Code: Click **Get Packages** located in right side of the action
     ribbon at the top of `pubspec.yaml` indicated by the Download icon.
   * From Android Studio/IntelliJ: Click **Pub get** in the action
     ribbon at the top of `pubspec.yaml`.

1. Import it
   * Add a corresponding `import` statement in the Dart code.

1. Stop and restart the app, if necessary
   * If the package brings platform-specific code
     (Kotlin/Java for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS),
     that code must be built into your app.
     Hot reload and hot restart only update the Dart code,
     so a full restart of the app might be required to avoid
     errors like `MissingPluginException` when using the package.

### Removing a package dependency to an app using `flutter pub remove`

To remove the package `css_colors` from an app:

1. Use the [`pub remove`][] command from inside the project directory
   * `flutter pub remove css_colors`

The [Installing tab][],
available on any package page on pub.dev,
is a handy reference for these steps.

For a complete example,
see the [css_colors example][] below.

[css_colors example]: #css-example
[Installing tab]: {{site.pub-pkg}}/css_colors/install
[`pub remove`]: {{site.dart-site}}/tools/pub/cmd/pub-remove

### Conflict resolution

Suppose you want to use `some_package` and
`another_package` in an app,
and both of these depend on `url_launcher`,
but in different versions.
That causes a potential conflict.
The best way to avoid this is for package authors to use
[version ranges][] rather than specific versions when
specifying dependencies.

```yaml
dependencies:
  url_launcher: ^5.4.0    # Good, any version >= 5.4.0 but < 6.0.0
  image_picker: '5.4.3'   # Not so good, only version 5.4.3 works.
```

If `some_package` declares the dependencies above
and `another_package` declares a compatible
`url_launcher` dependency like `'5.4.6'` or
`^5.5.0`, pub resolves the issue automatically.
Platform-specific dependencies on
[Gradle modules][] and/or [CocoaPods][]
are solved in a similar way.

Even if `some_package` and `another_package`
declare incompatible versions for `url_launcher`,
they might actually use `url_launcher` in
compatible ways. In this situation,
the conflict can be resolved by adding
a dependency override declaration to the app's
`pubspec.yaml` file, forcing the use of a particular version.

For example, to force the use of `url_launcher` version `5.4.0`,
make the following changes to the app's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  some_package:
  another_package:
dependency_overrides:
  url_launcher: '5.4.0'
```

If the conflicting dependency is not itself a package,
but an Android-specific library like `guava`,
the dependency override declaration must be added to
Gradle build logic instead.

To force the use of `guava` version `28.0`, make the following
changes to the app's `android/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        force 'com.google.guava:guava:28.0-android'
    }
}
```

CocoaPods doesn't currently offer dependency
override functionality.

## Developing new packages

If no package exists for your specific use case,
you can [write a custom package][].

## Managing package dependencies and versions

To minimize the risk of version collisions,
specify a version range in the `pubspec.yaml` file.

### Package versions

All packages have a version number, specified in the
package's `pubspec.yaml` file. The current version of a package
is displayed next to its name (for example,
see the [`url_launcher`][] package), as
well as a list of all prior versions
(see [`url_launcher` versions][]).

To ensure that the app doesn't break when you update a package,
specify a version range using one of the following formats.

* **Ranged constraints:** Specify a minimum and maximum version.

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    url_launcher: '>=5.4.0 <6.0.0'
  ```

* **Ranged constraints using the [caret syntax][]:**
  Specify the version that serves as the inclusive minimum version.
  This covers all versions from that version to the next major version.

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    collection: '^5.4.0'
  ```

  This syntax means the same as the one noted in the first bullet.

To learn more, check out the [package versioning guide][].

[caret syntax]: {{site.dart-site}}/tools/pub/dependencies#caret-syntax
[package versioning guide]: {{site.dart-site}}/tools/pub/versioning
[`url_launcher` versions]: {{site.pub-pkg}}/url_launcher/versions

### Updating package dependencies

When running `flutter pub get`
for the first time after adding a package,
Flutter saves the concrete package version found in the `pubspec.lock`
[lockfile][]. This ensures that you get the same version again
if you, or another developer on your team, run `flutter pub get`.

To upgrade to a new version of the package,
for example to use new features in that package,
run `flutter pub upgrade`
to retrieve the highest available version of the package
that is allowed by the version constraint specified in
`pubspec.yaml`.
Note that this is a different command from
`flutter upgrade` or `flutter update-packages`,
which both update Flutter itself.

[lockfile]: {{site.dart-site}}/tools/pub/glossary#lockfile

### Dependencies on unpublished packages

Packages can be used even when not published on pub.dev.
For private packages, or for packages not ready for publishing,
additional dependency options are available:

**Path dependency**
: A Flutter app can depend on a package using a file system
  `path:` dependency. The path can be either relative or absolute.
  Relative paths are evaluated relative to the directory
  containing `pubspec.yaml`. For example, to depend on a
  package, packageA, located in a directory next to the app,
  use the following syntax:

  ```yaml
    dependencies:
    packageA:
      path: ../packageA/
  
  ```

**Git dependency**
: You can also depend on a package stored in a Git repository.
  If the package is located at the root of the repo,
  use the following syntax:

  ```yaml
    dependencies:
      packageA:
        git:
          url: https://github.com/flutter/packageA.git
  ```

**Git dependency using SSH**
: If the repository is private and you can connect to it using SSH,
  depend on the package by using the repo's SSH url:

  ```yaml
    dependencies:
      packageA:
        git:
          url: git@github.com:flutter/packageA.git
  ```

**Git dependency on a package in a folder**
: Pub assumes the package is located in
  the root of the Git repository. If that isn't
  the case, specify the location with the `path` argument.
  For example:

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    packageA:
      git:
        url: https://github.com/flutter/packages.git
        path: packages/packageA
  ```

  Finally, use the `ref` argument to pin the dependency to a
  specific git commit, branch, or tag. For more details, see
  [Package dependencies][].

## Examples

The following examples walk through the necessary steps for
using packages.

### Example: Using the css_colors package {:#css-example}

The [`css_colors`][] package
defines color constants for CSS colors, so use the constants
wherever the Flutter framework expects the `Color` type.

To use this package:

1. Create a new project called `cssdemo`.

1. Open `pubspec.yaml`, and add the `css-colors` dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     css_colors: ^1.0.0
   ```

1. Run `flutter pub get` in the terminal,
   or click **Get Packages** in VS Code.

1. Open `lib/main.dart` and replace its full contents with:

    <?code-excerpt "lib/css_colors.dart (css-colors)"?>
    ```dart
    import 'package:css_colors/css_colors.dart';
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    
    void main() {
      runApp(const MyApp());
    }
    
    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
      const MyApp({super.key});
    
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return const MaterialApp(
          home: DemoPage(),
        );
      }
    }
    
    class DemoPage extends StatelessWidget {
      const DemoPage({super.key});
    
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold(body: Container(color: CSSColors.orange));
      }
    }
    ```

[`css_colors`]: {{site.pub-pkg}}/css_colors

1. Run the app. The app's background should now be orange.

### Example: Using the url_launcher package to launch the browser {:#url-example}

The [`url_launcher`][] plugin package enables opening
the default browser on the mobile platform to display
a given URL, and is supported on Android, iOS, web,
Windows, Linux, and macOS.
This package is a special Dart package called a
_plugin package_ (or _plugin_),
which includes platform-specific code.

To use this plugin:

1. Create a new project called `launchdemo`.

1. Open `pubspec.yaml`, and add the `url_launcher` dependency:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     url_launcher: ^5.4.0
   ```

1. Run `flutter pub get` in the terminal,
   or click **Get Packages get** in VS Code.

1. Open `lib/main.dart` and replace its full contents with the
   following:

    <?code-excerpt "lib/url_launcher.dart (url-launcher)"?>
    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    import 'package:path/path.dart' as p;
    import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';
    
    void main() {
      runApp(const MyApp());
    }
    
    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
      const MyApp({super.key});
    
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return const MaterialApp(
          home: DemoPage(),
        );
      }
    }
    
    class DemoPage extends StatelessWidget {
      const DemoPage({super.key});
    
      void launchURL() {
        launchUrl(p.toUri('https://flutter.dev'));
      }
    
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold(
          body: Center(
            child: ElevatedButton(
              onPressed: launchURL,
              child: const Text('Show Flutter homepage'),
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
    }
    ```

1. Run the app (or stop and restart it, if it was already running
   before adding the plugin). Click **Show Flutter homepage**.
   You should see the default browser open on the device,
   displaying the homepage for flutter.dev.
