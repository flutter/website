title: Background processes
description: Where to find more information on implementing background processes in Flutter.

Have you ever wanted to execute Dart code in the
backgroundâ€”even if your app wasn't the currently active app?
Perhaps you wanted to implement a process that watches the time,
or that catches camera movement.
In Flutter, you can execute Dart code in the background.

The mechanism for this feature involves setting up an isolate.
_Isolates_ are Dart's model for multithreading,
though an isolate differs from a conventional thread
in that it doesn't share memory with the main program.
You'll set up your isolate for background execution using
callbacks and a callback dispatcher.

Additionally, the [WorkManager] plugin enables persistent background processing
that keeps tasks scheduled through app restarts and system reboots.

For more information and a geofencing example that uses background
execution of Dart code, see the Medium article by Ben Konyi,
[Executing Dart in the Background with Flutter Plugins and
Geofencing][background-processes].  At the end of this article,
you'll find links to example code, and relevant documentation for Dart,
iOS, and Android.
