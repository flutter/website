The aim of the **Flutter Favorite** program is to identify
packages and plugins that you should first consider when
building your app.
This is not a guarantee of quality or suitability to your
particular situation&mdash;you should always perform your
own evaluation of packages and plugins for your project.

You can see the complete list of
[Flutter Favorite packages][] on pub.dev.

If you came here looking for the Happy Paths recommendations,
we have discontinued that project in favor of Flutter Favorites.

## Metrics

Flutter Favorite packages have passed high quality standards
using the following metrics:

* [Overall package score][]
* **Permissive license**,
  including (but not limited to)
  Apache, Artistic, BSD, CC BY, MIT, MS-PL and W3C
* GitHub **version tag** matches the current version from
  pub.dev, so you can see exactly what source is in the package
* Feature **completeness**&mdash;and not marked as incomplete
  (for example, with labels like "beta" or "under construction")
* [Verified publisher][]
* General **usability** when it comes to the overview,
  docs, sample/example code, and API quality
* Good **runtime behavior** in terms of CPU and memory usage
* High quality **dependencies**

## Flutter Ecosystem  Committee

The Flutter Ecosystem Committee is comprised of Flutter
team members and Flutter community members spread
across its ecosystem.
One of their jobs is to decide when a package
has met the quality bar to become a Flutter Favorite.

The current committee members
(ordered alphabetically by last name)
are as follows:

* Pooja Bhaumik
* Hillel Coren
* Ander Dobo
* Simon Lightfoot
* Lara Mart√≠n
* John Ryan
* Diego Velasquez

If you'd like to nominate a package or plugin as a
potential future Flutter Favorite, or would like
to bring any other issues to the attention of the committee,
[send the committee][] an email.

## Flutter Favorite usage guidelines

Flutter Favorite packages are labeled as such on pub.dev
by the Flutter team.
If you own a package that has been designated as a Flutter Favorite,
you must adhere to the following guidelines:

* Flutter Favorite package authors can place the Flutter Favorite
  logo in the package's GitHub README, on the package's
  pub.dev **Overview** tab,
  and on social media as related to posts about that package.
* We encourage you to use the **#FlutterFavorite**
  hashtag in social media.
* When using the Flutter Favorite logo,
  the author must link to (this) Flutter Favorite landing page,
  to provide context for the designation.
* If a Flutter Favorite package loses its Flutter Favorite status,
  the author will be notified,
  at which point the author must immediately remove all uses
  of "Flutter Favorite" and the Flutter Favorite logo from
  the affected package.
* Don't alter, distort,
  or modify the Flutter Favorite logo in any way,
  including displaying the logo with color variations
  or unapproved visual elements.
* Don't display the Flutter Favorite logo in a manner that
  is misleading, unfair, defamatory, infringing, libelous,
  disparaging, obscene, or otherwise objectionable to Google.

## What's next

You should expect the list of Flutter Favorite packages
to grow and change as the ecosystem continues to thrive.
The committee will continue working with package authors
to increase quality, as well as consider other areas of the
ecosystem that could benefit from the Flutter Favorite program,
such as tools, consulting firms, and prolific Flutter contributors.

As the Flutter ecosystem grows,
we'll be looking at expanding the set of metrics,
which might include the following:

* Use of the [pubspec.yaml format][] that clearly
  indicates which platforms a plugin supports.
* Support for the latest stable version of Flutter.
* Support for AndroidX.
* Support for multiple platforms, such as web, macOS,
  Windows, Linux, etc.
* Integration as well as unit test coverage.
