Here's a collection of books about Flutter,
in alphabetical order.
If you find another one that we should add,
[file an issue][] and (feel free to)
submit a PR ([sample][]) to add it yourself.

Also, check the Flutter version that the book
was written under. Anything published before
Flutter 3.10/Dart 3 (May 2023),
won't reflect the latest version of Dart and
might not include null safety;
anything published before Flutter 3.16 (November 2023)
won't reflect that Material 3 is now
Flutter's default theme.
See the [what's new][]
page to view Flutter's latest release.
