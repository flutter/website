The Google AI Dart SDK enables you to use Google's
state-of-the-art generative AI models (like Gemini)
to build AI-powered features and applications.

Integrate features like advanced text generation,
summarization, chat, and more to your Dart or Flutter
apps with minimal setup, and deploy across multiple platforms.

The **NEW** [Flutter AI Toolkit][] shows you how to integrate
an AI generated chatbot into your Flutter app.
**Check it out!**
