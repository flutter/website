description: Where can you get support when developing with Flutter.
---

Welcome!

There are many different ways to get support
when developing with Flutter.
As Flutter is an open source project,
your options range from filing issues when you
run into bugs in the software,
to connecting with your local community,
to browsing and identifying a list of commercial agencies
and consultants who offer support services.

## I want to report an issue with Flutter

Visit how to [create a useful bug report](/resources/bug-reports).
Note that filing bugs is _not_ an efficient way to get tech support.

## I want to ask questions about how to use Flutter

Your best bet is to consult
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flutter),
or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rflutterdev).
While the community is active in these channels,
there is no official SLA on responding to new posts
or chats in these channels.

## I want professional services support with Flutter

Check out the
[Flutter consultants]({{site.main-url}}/consultants)
directory.

## I want support from a Flutter expert

Google has a cadre of [Google Developer Experts][] (GDEs),
non-Google employees with expertise in various areas
of Google technologies, such as Flutter and Dart.
GDEs are _not_ free consultants, but they often give
lectures, host meetups, run workshops, or make videos.
As part of the Dart and Flutter world-wide community,
they are a great resource.

## I want to get paid support from Google or the Flutter project

As an open source project,
we're not set up to offer paid support.
We recommend checking out the
[consultancy program]({{site.main-url}}/consultants).
