Learn how to use VS Code to
quickly set up your Flutter development environment.

:::tip
If you've never set up or developed an app with Flutter before,
follow [Get started with Flutter][] instead.

[Get started with Flutter]: /get-started/install

## Choose your development platform {: #dev-platform}

The instructions on this page are configured to cover
installing Flutter on a **Windows**{:.selected-os-text} device.

If you'd like to follow the instructions for a different OS,
please select one of the following.

## Download prerequisite software {: #download-prerequisites}

For the smoothest Flutter setup,
first install the following tools.

 1. <h3>Set up Linux support</h3>

    If you haven't set up Linux support on your Chromebook before,
    [Turn on Linux support][chromeos-linux].

    If you've already turned on Linux support,
    ensure it's up to date following the
    [Fix problems with Linux][chromeos-linux-update] instructions.

 1. <h3>Download and install prerequisite packages</h3>

    Using `apt-get` or your preferred installation mechanism,
    install the latest versions of the following packages:

    - `curl`
    - `git`
    - `unzip`
    - `xz-utils`
    - `zip`
    - `libglu1-mesa`

    If you want to use `apt-get`,
    install these packages using the following commands:

    ```console
    $ sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
    $ sudo apt-get install -y curl git unzip xz-utils zip libglu1-mesa
    ```

 1. <h3>Download and install Visual Studio Code</h3>

    To quickly install Flutter, then edit and debug your apps,
    [install and set up Visual Studio Code][vscode-install].

    ```console
    $ xcode-select --install
    ```

    If you haven't installed the tools already,
    a dialog should open that confirms you'd like to install them.
    Click **Install**, then once the installation is complete, click **Done**.

## Install and set up Flutter {: #install-flutter}

Now that you've installed Git and VS Code,
follow these steps to use VS Code to install and set up Flutter.

 1. <h3>Launch VS Code</h3>

    If not already open, open VS Code by searching for it with Spotlight
    or opening it manually from the directory where it's installed.

 1. <h3>Add the Flutter extension to VS Code</h3>

    To add the Dart and Flutter extensions to VS Code,
    visit the [Flutter extension's marketplace page][flutter-vscode],
    and click **Install**.
    If prompted by your browser, allow it to open VS Code.

 1. <h3>Install Flutter with VS Code</h3>

    1. Open the command palette in VS Code.

       Go to **View** <span aria-label="and then">></span> **Command Palette**
       or press <kbd class="special-key">Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> +
       <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>.

    1. In the command palette, type `flutter`.

    1. Select **Flutter: New Project**.

    1. VS Code prompts you to locate the Flutter SDK on your computer.
       Select **Download SDK**.

    1. When the **Select Folder for Flutter SDK** dialog displays,
       choose where you want to install Flutter.

    1. Click **Clone Flutter**.

       While downloading Flutter, VS Code displays this pop-up notification:

       ```console
       Downloading the Flutter SDK. This may take a few minutes.
       ```

       This download takes a few minutes.
       If you suspect that the download has hung, click **Cancel** then
       start the installation again.

    1. Click **Add SDK to PATH**.

       When successful, a notification displays:

       ```console
       The Flutter SDK was added to your PATH
       ```

    1. VS Code might display a Google Analytics notice.

       If you agree, click **OK**.

    1. To ensure that Flutter is available in all terminals:

       1. Close, then reopen all terminal windows.
       1. Restart VS Code.

       {:type="a"}

 1. <h3>Validate your setup</h3>

    To ensure you installed Flutter correctly,
    run `flutter doctor -v` in your preferred terminal.

    If the command isn't found or there's an error,
    check out [Flutter installation troubleshooting][troubleshoot].

## Continue your Flutter journey {: #next-steps}

Now that you've successfully installed Flutter,
set up development for at least one target platform
to continue your journey with Flutter.

If you don't yet have a preferred platform
to target during development,
the Flutter team recommends you first try out
[developing for the web][web-setup]!
