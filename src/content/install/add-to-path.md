Learn how to add Flutter to your `PATH` environment variable
after downloading the SDK.
Adding Flutter to your `PATH` allows you to use the
`flutter` and `dart` command-line tools in terminals and IDEs.

## Windows

To run `flutter` and `dart` commands in a terminal on Windows,
add the Flutter SDK's `bin` directory to the `Path` environment variable.

 1. <h3>Determine your Flutter SDK installation location</h3>

    Copy the absolute path to the directory that you
    downloaded and extracted the Flutter SDK into.

 1. <h3>Navigate to the environment variables settings</h3>

   1. Press <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>Pause</kbd>.

      If your keyboard lacks a <kbd>Pause</kbd> key,
      try <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>.

      The **System > About** dialog opens.

   1. Click **Advanced System Settings**
      <span aria-label="and then">></span> **Advanced**
      <span aria-label="and then">></span> **Environment Variables...**

      The **Environment Variables** dialog opens.

 1. <h3>Add the Flutter SDK bin to your path</h3>

   1. In the **User variables for (username)** section
      of the **Environment Variables** dialog,
      look for the **Path** entry.

   1. If the **Path** entry exists, double-click it.

      The **Edit Environment Variable** dialog should open.

      1. Double-click inside an empty row.

      1. Type the path to the `bin` directory of your Flutter installation.

         For example, if you downloaded Flutter into a
         `dev\flutter` folder inside your user directory,
         you'd type the following:

         ```plaintext
         %USERPROFILE%\dev\flutter\bin
         ```

      1. Click the Flutter entry you added to select it.

      1. Click **Move Up** until the Flutter entry sits at the top of the list.

      1. To confirm your changes, click **OK** three times.

      {: type="a"}

   1. If the entry doesn't exist, click **New...**.

      The **Edit Environment Variable** dialog should open.

      1. In the **Variable Name** box, type `Path`.

      1. In the **Variable Value** box,
         type the path to the `bin` directory of your Flutter installation.

         For example, if you downloaded Flutter into a
         `dev\flutter` folder inside your user directory,
         you'd type the following:

         ```plaintext
         %USERPROFILE%\dev\flutter\bin
         ```

      1. To confirm your changes, click **OK** three times.

      {: type="a"}

 1. <h3>Apply your changes</h3>

    To apply this change and get access to the `flutter` tool,
    close and reopen all open command prompts,
    sessions in your terminal apps, and IDEs.

 1. <h3>Validate your setup</h3>

    To ensure you successfully added the SDK to your `PATH`,
    open command prompt or your preferred terminal app,
    then try running the `flutter` and `dart` tools.

    ```console
    $ flutter --version
    $ dart --version
    ```

    If either command isn't found,
    check out [Flutter installation troubleshooting][troubleshoot].

{: .steps}

## macOS

To run `flutter` and `dart` commands in a terminal on macOS,
add the Flutter SDK's `bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable.

:::note
The following steps assume you're
using the [default shell][zsh-mac] on macOS, Zsh.
Zsh uses the `.zshenv` file for configuring [environment variables][zsh-files].

If you use another shell besides Zsh,
check out [this tutorial on setting your PATH][other-path].
:::

 1. <h3>Determine your Flutter SDK installation location</h3>

    Copy the absolute path to the directory that you
    downloaded and extracted the Flutter SDK into.

 1. <h3>Open or create the Zsh environment variable file</h3>

    If it exists, open the Zsh environment variable file `~/.zshenv`
    in your preferred text editor.
    If it doesn't exist, create the `~/.zshenv` file.

 1. <h3>Add the Flutter SDK bin to your path</h3>

    At the end of your `~/.zshenv` file,
    use the built-in `export` command to update the `PATH` variable
    to include the `bin` directory of your Flutter installation.

    Replace `<path-to-sdk>` with the path to your Flutter SDK install.

    ```bash
    export PATH="<path-to-sdk>/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    For example, if you downloaded Flutter into a
    `development/flutter` folder inside your user directory,
    you'd add the following to the file:

    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/development/flutter/bin:$PATH"
    ```

 1. <h3>Save your changes</h3>

    Save, then close, the `~/.zshenv` file you edited.

 1. <h3>Apply your changes</h3>

    To apply this change and get access to the `flutter` tool,
    close and reopen all open Zsh sessions in your terminal apps and IDEs.

 1. <h3>Validate your setup</h3>

    To ensure you successfully added the SDK to your `PATH`,
    open a Zsh session in your preferred terminal,
    then try running the `flutter` and `dart` tools.

    ```console
    $ flutter --version
    $ dart --version
    ```

    If either command isn't found,
    check out [Flutter installation troubleshooting][troubleshoot].

## Linux

To run `flutter` and `dart` commands in a terminal on Linux,
add the Flutter SDK's `bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable.

 1. <h3>Determine your Flutter SDK installation location</h3>

    Copy the absolute path to the directory that you
    downloaded and extracted the Flutter SDK into.

 1. <h3>Determine your default shell</h3>

    If you don't know what shell you use,
    check which shell starts when you open a new console window.

    ```console
    $ echo $SHELL
    ```

 1. <h3>Add the Flutter SDK bin to your path</h3>

    To add the `bin` directory of your Flutter installation to your `PATH`:

    1. Expand the instructions for your default shell.
    1. Copy the provided command.
    1. Replace `<path-to-sdk>` with the path to your Flutter SDK install.
    1. Run the edited command in your preferred terminal with that shell.

## ChromeOS

To run `flutter` and `dart` commands in a terminal on chromeOS,
add the Flutter SDK's `bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable.

:::note
The following steps assume
you've already [turned on Linux support][chromeos-linux] and that
you're using Bash or the default shell on ChromeOS.

If you're using a different shell besides the default or Bash,
follow the [add to path instructions for Linux](#linux) instead.
