Learn how to install and manually set up
your Flutter development environment.

:::tip
If you've never set up or developed an app with Flutter before,
follow [Get started with Flutter][] instead.

If you're just looking to quickly install Flutter,
consider [installing Flutter with VS Code][with-vs-code] for
a streamlined setup experience.

## Choose your development platform {: #dev-platform}

The instructions on this page are configured to cover
installing Flutter on a **Windows**{:.selected-os-text} device.

If you'd like to follow the instructions for a different OS,
please select one of the following.

## Download prerequisite software {: #download-prerequisites}

Before installing the Flutter SDK,
first complete the following setup.

 1. <h3>Install Git for Windows</h3>

    Download and install the latest version of [Git for Windows][].

    For help installing or troubleshooting Git,
    reference the [Git documentation][git-install].

 1. <h3>Set up an editor or IDE</h3>

 1. <h3>Install the Xcode command-line tools</h3>

    Download the Xcode command-line tools to get access to
    the command-line tools that Flutter relies on, including Git.

    To download the tools, run the following command in your preferred terminal:

    ```console
    $ xcode-select --install
    ```

    If you haven't installed the tools already,
    a dialog should open that confirms you'd like to install them.
    Click **Install**, then once the installation is complete, click **Done**.

## Install and set up Flutter {: #install-flutter}

To install the Flutter SDK,
download the latest bundle from the SDK archive,
then extract the SDK to where you want it stored.

 1. <h3>Download the Flutter SDK bundle</h3>

    Download the following installation bundle to get the
    latest stable release of the Flutter SDK.

    [(loading...)](#){:.download-latest-link-windows .filled-button}

 1. <h3>Create a folder to store the SDK</h3>

    Create or find a folder to store the extracted SDK in.
    Consider creating and using a directory at
    `%USERPROFILE%\develop` (`C:\Users\{username}\develop`).

    :::note
    Select a location that
    doesn't have special characters or spaces in its path and
    doesn't require elevated privileges.
    :::

 1. <h3>Extract the SDK</h3>

    Extract the SDK bundle you downloaded into
    the directory you want to store the Flutter SDK in.

    1. Copy the following command.
    1. Replace `<sdk_zip_path>` with the path the bundle you downloaded.
    1. Replace `<destination_directory_path>` with the path to the
       folder you want the extracted SDK to be in.
    1. Run the edited command in your preferred terminal.

    ```console
    $ Expand-Archive –Path <sdk_zip_path> -Destination <destination_directory_path>
    ```

    For example, if you downloaded the bundle for Flutter 3.29.3 into
    the `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads` directory and want to
    store the extracted SDK in the `%USERPROFILE%\develop` directory:

    ```console
    $ Expand-Archive `
      –Path $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\flutter_windows_3.29.3-stable.zip `
      -Destination $env:USERPROFILE\develop\
    ```

{: .steps .windows-only}

 1. <h3>Download the Flutter SDK bundle</h3>

    Depending on your macOS device's cpu architecture,
    download one of the following installation bundles to get the
    latest stable release of the Flutter SDK.

    | Apple Silicon (ARM64)                                                               | Intel (x64)                                                    |

    | [(loading...)](#){:.download-latest-link-macos-arm64 .apple-silicon .filled-button} | [(loading...)](#){:.download-latest-link-macos .filled-button} |

 1. <h3>Create a folder to store the SDK</h3>

    Create or find a folder to store the extracted SDK in.
    Consider creating and using a directory at `~/develop/`.

 1. <h3>Extract the SDK</h3>

    Extract the SDK bundle you downloaded into
    the directory you want to store the Flutter SDK in.

    1. Copy the following command.
    1. Replace `<sdk_zip_path>` with the path the bundle you downloaded.
    1. Replace `<destination_directory_path>` with the path to the

## Add Flutter to your PATH {: #add-to-path}

Now that you've downloaded the SDK,
add the Flutter SDK's `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
Adding Flutter to your `PATH` allows you to use the
`flutter` and `dart` command-line tools in terminals and IDEs.

## Continue your Flutter journey {: #next-steps}

Now that you've successfully installed Flutter,
set up development for at least one target platform
to continue your journey with Flutter.
