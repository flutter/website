There's a wide variety of tools and features to help debug
Flutter applications. Here are some of the available tools:

* [VS Code][](recommended) and [Android Studio/IntelliJ][], 
  (enabled with the Flutter and Dart plugins)
  support a built-in source-level debugger with
  the ability to set breakpoints, step through code,
  and examine values.
* [DevTools][], a suite of performance and profiling
  tools that run in a browser.
* [Flutter inspector][], a widget inspector available
  in DevTools, and also directly from Android Studio
  and IntelliJ (enabled with the Flutter plugin).
  The inspector allows you to examine a visual
  representation of the widget tree, inspect
  individual widgets and their property values,
  enable the performance overlay, and more.
