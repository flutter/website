<?code-excerpt path-base="get-started/flutter-for/android_devs"?>

This document is meant for Android developers looking to apply their
existing Android knowledge to build mobile apps with Flutter.
If you understand the fundamentals of the Android framework then you
can use this document as a jump start to Flutter development.

:::note
To integrate Flutter code into your Android app, see
[Add Flutter to existing app][].
:::

Your Android knowledge and skill set are highly valuable when building with
Flutter, because Flutter relies on the mobile operating system for numerous
capabilities and configurations. Flutter is a new way to build UIs for mobile,
but it has a plugin system to communicate with Android (and iOS) for non-UI
tasks. If you're an expert with Android, you don't have to relearn everything
to use Flutter.

This document can be used as a cookbook by jumping around and
finding questions that are most relevant to your needs.

## Views

### What is the equivalent of a View in Flutter?

:::secondary
How is react-style, or _declarative_, programming different than the
traditional imperative style?
For a comparison, see [Introduction to declarative UI][].
:::

In Android, the `View` is the foundation of everything that shows up on the
screen. Buttons, toolbars, and inputs, everything is a View.
In Flutter, the rough equivalent to a `View` is a `Widget`.
Widgets don't map exactly to Android views, but while you're getting
acquainted with how Flutter works you can think of them as
"the way you declare and construct UI".

However, these have a few differences to a `View`. To start, widgets have a
different lifespan: they are immutable and only exist until they need to be
changed. Whenever widgets or their state change, Flutter's framework creates
a new tree of widget instances. In comparison, an Android view is drawn once
and does not redraw until `invalidate` is called.

Flutter's widgets are lightweight, in part due to their immutability.
Because they aren't views themselves, and aren't directly drawing anything,
but rather are a description of the UI and its semantics that get "inflated"
into actual view objects under the hood.

Flutter includes the [Material Components][] library.
These are widgets that implement the
[Material Design guidelines][]. Material Design is a
flexible design system [optimized for all platforms][],
including iOS.

But Flutter is flexible and expressive enough to implement any design language.
For example, on iOS, you can use the [Cupertino widgets][]
to produce an interface that looks like [Apple's iOS design language][].

### How do I update widgets?

In Android, you update your views by directly mutating them. However,
in Flutter, `Widget`s are immutable and are not updated directly,
instead you have to work with the widget's state.

This is where the concept of `Stateful` and `Stateless` widgets comes from.
A `StatelessWidget` is just what it sounds like&mdash;a
widget with no state information.

`StatelessWidgets` are useful when the part of the user interface
you are describing does not depend on anything other than the configuration
information in the object.

For example, in Android, this is similar to placing an `ImageView`
with your logo. The logo is not going to change during runtime,
so use a `StatelessWidget` in Flutter.

If you want to dynamically change the UI based on data received
after making an HTTP call or user interaction then you have to work
with `StatefulWidget` and tell the Flutter framework that the widget's
`State` has been updated so it can update that widget.

The important thing to note here is at the core both stateless and stateful
widgets behave the same. They rebuild every frame, the difference is the
`StatefulWidget` has a `State` object that stores state data across frames
and restores it.

If you are in doubt, then always remember this rule: if a widget changes
(because of user interactions, for example) it's stateful.
However, if a widget reacts to change, the containing parent widget can
still be stateless if it doesn't itself react to change.

The following example shows how to use a `StatelessWidget`. A common
`StatelessWidget` is the `Text` widget. If you look at the implementation of
the `Text` widget you'll find that it subclasses `StatelessWidget`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/text_widget.dart (text-widget)" replace="/return const //g"?>
```dart
Text(
  'I like Flutter!',
  style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
);
```

As you can see, the `Text` Widget has no state information associated with it,
it renders what is passed in its constructors and nothing more.

But, what if you want to make "I Like Flutter" change dynamically, for
example when clicking a `FloatingActionButton`?

To achieve this, wrap the `Text` widget in a `StatefulWidget` and
update it when the user clicks the button.

For example:

<?code-excerpt "lib/text_widget.dart (stateful-widget)"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleAppPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleAppPage> createState() => _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  // Default placeholder text.
  String textToShow = 'I Like Flutter';

  void _updateText() {
    setState(() {
      // Update the text.
      textToShow = 'Flutter is Awesome!';
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Sample App'),
      ),
      body: Center(child: Text(textToShow)),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _updateText,
        tooltip: 'Update Text',
        child: const Icon(Icons.update),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### How do I lay out my widgets? Where is my XML layout file?

In Android, you write layouts in XML, but in Flutter you write your layouts
with a widget tree.

The following example shows how to display a simple widget with padding:

<?code-excerpt "lib/layout.dart (simple-widget)"?>
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: const Text('Sample App'),
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: ElevatedButton(
        style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.only(left: 20, right: 30),
        ),
        onPressed: () {},
        child: const Text('Hello'),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

You can view some of the layouts that Flutter has to offer in the
[widget catalog][].

### How do I add or remove a component from my layout?

In Android, you call `addChild()` or `removeChild()`
on a parent to dynamically add or remove child views.
In Flutter, because widgets are immutable there is
no direct equivalent to `addChild()`.  Instead,
you can pass a function to the parent that returns a widget,
and control that child's creation with a boolean flag.

For example, here is how you can toggle between two
widgets when you click on a `FloatingActionButton`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/layout.dart (toggle-widget)"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleAppPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleAppPage> createState() => _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  // Default value for toggle.
  bool toggle = true;
  void _toggle() {
    setState(() {
      toggle = !toggle;
    });
  }

  Widget _getToggleChild() {
    if (toggle) {
      return const Text('Toggle One');
    } else {
      return ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: () {},
        child: const Text('Toggle Two'),
      );
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Sample App'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _getToggleChild(),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _toggle,
        tooltip: 'Update Text',
        child: const Icon(Icons.update),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### How do I animate a widget?

In Android, you either create animations using XML, or call the `animate()`
method on a view. In Flutter, animate widgets using the animation
library by wrapping widgets inside an animated widget.

In Flutter, use an `AnimationController` which is an `Animation<double>`
that can pause, seek, stop and reverse the animation. It requires a `Ticker`
that signals when vsync happens, and produces a linear interpolation between
0 and 1 on each frame while it's running. You then create one or more
`Animation`s and attach them to the controller.

For example, you might use `CurvedAnimation` to implement an animation
along an interpolated curve. In this sense, the controller
is the "master" source of the animation progress and the `CurvedAnimation`
computes the curve that replaces the controller's default linear motion.
Like widgets, animations in Flutter work with composition.

When building the widget tree you assign the `Animation` to an animated
property of a widget, such as the opacity of a `FadeTransition`, and tell the
controller to start the animation.

The following example shows how to write a `FadeTransition` that fades the
widget into a logo when you press the `FloatingActionButton`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/animation.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const FadeAppTest());
}

class FadeAppTest extends StatelessWidget {
  const FadeAppTest({super.key});
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Fade Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const MyFadeTest(title: 'Fade Demo'),
    );
  }
}

class MyFadeTest extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyFadeTest({super.key, required this.title});

  final String title;
  @override
  State<MyFadeTest> createState() => _MyFadeTest();
}

class _MyFadeTest extends State<MyFadeTest> with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController controller;
  late CurvedAnimation curve;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    controller = AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 2000),
      vsync: this,
    );
    curve = CurvedAnimation(
      parent: controller,
      curve: Curves.easeIn,
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(widget.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: FadeTransition(
          opacity: curve,
          child: const FlutterLogo(
            size: 100,
          ),
        ),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        tooltip: 'Fade',
        onPressed: () {
          controller.forward();
        },
        child: const Icon(Icons.brush),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

and the [Animations overview][].

### How do I use a Canvas to draw/paint?

In Android, you would use the `Canvas` and `Drawable`
to draw images and shapes to the screen.
Flutter has a similar `Canvas` API as well,
since it's based on the same low-level rendering engine, Skia.
As a result, painting to a canvas in Flutter
is a very familiar task for Android developers.

Flutter has two classes that help you draw to the canvas: `CustomPaint`
and `CustomPainter`,
the latter of which implements your algorithm to draw to the canvas.

To learn how to implement a signature painter in Flutter,
see Collin's answer on [Custom Paint][].

<?code-excerpt "lib/canvas.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(const MaterialApp(home: DemoApp()));

class DemoApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const DemoApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => const Scaffold(body: Signature());
}

class Signature extends StatefulWidget {
  const Signature({super.key});

  @override
  SignatureState createState() => SignatureState();
}

class SignatureState extends State<Signature> {
  List<Offset?> _points = <Offset>[];
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onPanUpdate: (details) {
        setState(() {
          RenderBox? referenceBox = context.findRenderObject() as RenderBox;
          Offset localPosition =
              referenceBox.globalToLocal(details.globalPosition);
          _points = List.from(_points)..add(localPosition);
        });
      },
      onPanEnd: (details) => _points.add(null),
      child: CustomPaint(
        painter: SignaturePainter(_points),
        size: Size.infinite,
      ),
    );
  }
}

class SignaturePainter extends CustomPainter {
  SignaturePainter(this.points);
  final List<Offset?> points;
  @override
  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
    var paint = Paint()
      ..color = Colors.black
      ..strokeCap = StrokeCap.round
      ..strokeWidth = 5;
    for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {
      if (points[i] != null && points[i + 1] != null) {
        canvas.drawLine(points[i]!, points[i + 1]!, paint);
      }
    }
  }

  @override
  bool shouldRepaint(SignaturePainter oldDelegate) =>
      oldDelegate.points != points;
}
```

### How do I build custom widgets?

In Android, you typically subclass `View`, or use a pre-existing view,
to override and implement methods that achieve the desired behavior.

In Flutter, build a custom widget by [composing][]
smaller widgets (instead of extending them).
It is somewhat similar to implementing a custom `ViewGroup`
in Android, where all the building blocks are already existing,
but you provide a different behavior&mdash;for example,
custom layout logic.

For example, how do you build a `CustomButton` that takes a label in
the constructor? Create a CustomButton that composes a `ElevatedButton` with
a label, rather than by extending `ElevatedButton`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/custom.dart (custom-button)"?>
```dart
class CustomButton extends StatelessWidget {
  final String label;

  const CustomButton(this.label, {super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {},
      child: Text(label),
    );
  }
}
```

Then use `CustomButton`, just as you'd use any other Flutter widget:

<?code-excerpt "lib/custom.dart (use-custom-button)"?>
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return const Center(
    child: CustomButton('Hello'),
  );
}
```

## Intents

### What is the equivalent of an Intent in Flutter?

In Android, there are two main use cases for `Intent`s: navigating between
Activities, and communicating with components. Flutter, on the other hand,
does not have the concept of intents, although you can still start intents
through native integrations (using [a plugin][]).

Flutter doesn't really have a direct equivalent to activities and fragments;
rather, in Flutter you navigate between screens, using a `Navigator` and
`Route`s, all within the same `Activity`.

A `Route` is an abstraction for a "screen" or "page" of an app, and a
`Navigator` is a widget that manages routes. A route roughly maps to an
`Activity`, but it does not carry the same meaning. A navigator can push
and pop routes to move from screen to screen. Navigators work like a stack
on which you can `push()` new routes you want to navigate to, and from
which you can `pop()` routes when you want to "go back".

In Android, you declare your activities inside the app's `AndroidManifest.xml`.

In Flutter, you have a couple options to navigate between pages:

* Specify a `Map` of route names. (using `MaterialApp`)
* Directly navigate to a route. (using `WidgetsApp`)

The following example builds a Map.

<?code-excerpt "lib/intent.dart (map)"?>
```dart
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: const MyAppHome(), // Becomes the route named '/'.
    routes: <String, WidgetBuilder>{
      '/a': (context) => const MyPage(title: 'page A'),
      '/b': (context) => const MyPage(title: 'page B'),
      '/c': (context) => const MyPage(title: 'page C'),
    },
  ));
}
```

Navigate to a route by `push`ing its name to the `Navigator`.

<?code-excerpt "lib/intent.dart (push)"?>
```dart
Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/b');
```

The other popular use-case for `Intent`s is to call external components such
as a Camera or File picker. For this, you would need to create a native platform
integration (or use an [existing plugin][]).

To learn how to build a native platform integration,
see [developing packages and plugins][].

### How do I handle incoming intents from external applications in Flutter?

Flutter can handle incoming intents from Android by directly talking to the
Android layer and requesting the data that was shared.

The following example registers a text share intent filter on the native
activity that runs our Flutter code, so other apps can share text with
our Flutter app.

The basic flow implies that we first handle the shared text data on the
Android native side (in our `Activity`), and then wait until Flutter requests
for the data to provide it using a `MethodChannel`.

First, register the intent filter for all intents in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<activity
  android:name=".MainActivity"
  android:launchMode="singleTop"
  android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
  android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|locale|layoutDirection"
  android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
  android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
  <!-- ... -->
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <data android:mimeType="text/plain" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

Then in `MainActivity`, handle the intent, extract the text that was
shared from the intent, and hold onto it. When Flutter is ready to process,
it requests the data using a platform channel, and it's sent
across from the native side:

```java
package com.example.shared;

import android.content.Intent;
import android.os.Bundle;

import androidx.annotation.NonNull;

import io.flutter.plugin.common.MethodChannel;
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity;
import io.flutter.embedding.engine.FlutterEngine;
import io.flutter.plugins.GeneratedPluginRegistrant;

public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {

  private String sharedText;
  private static final String CHANNEL = "app.channel.shared.data";

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    Intent intent = getIntent();
    String action = intent.getAction();
    String type = intent.getType();

    if (Intent.ACTION_SEND.equals(action) && type != null) {
      if ("text/plain".equals(type)) {
        handleSendText(intent); // Handle text being sent
      }
    }
  }

  @Override
  public void configureFlutterEngine(@NonNull FlutterEngine flutterEngine) {
      GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(flutterEngine);

      new MethodChannel(flutterEngine.getDartExecutor().getBinaryMessenger(), CHANNEL)
              .setMethodCallHandler(
                      (call, result) -> {
                          if (call.method.contentEquals("getSharedText")) {
                              result.success(sharedText);
                              sharedText = null;
                          }
                      }
              );
  }

  void handleSendText(Intent intent) {
    sharedText = intent.getStringExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT);
  }
}
```

Finally, request the data from the Flutter side
when the widget is rendered:

<?code-excerpt "lib/request_data.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample Shared App Handler',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleAppPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleAppPage> createState() => _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  static const platform = MethodChannel('app.channel.shared.data');
  String dataShared = 'No data';

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    getSharedText();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(body: Center(child: Text(dataShared)));
  }

  Future<void> getSharedText() async {
    var sharedData = await platform.invokeMethod('getSharedText');
    if (sharedData != null) {
      setState(() {
        dataShared = sharedData;
      });
    }
  }
}
```

### What is the equivalent of startActivityForResult()?

The `Navigator` class handles routing in Flutter and is used to get
a result back from a route that you have pushed on the stack.
This is done by `await`ing on the `Future` returned by `push()`.

For example, to start a location route that lets the user select
their location, you could do the following:

<?code-excerpt "lib/intent.dart (push-await)"?>
```dart
Object? coordinates = await Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/location');
```

And then, inside your location route, once the user has selected their location
you can `pop` the stack with the result:

<?code-excerpt "lib/intent.dart (pop)"?>
```dart
Navigator.of(context).pop({'lat': 43.821757, 'long': -79.226392});
```

## Async UI

### What is the equivalent of runOnUiThread() in Flutter?

Dart has a single-threaded execution model, with support for `Isolate`s
(a way to run Dart code on another thread), an event loop, and
asynchronous programming. Unless you spawn an `Isolate`, your Dart code
runs in the main UI thread and is driven by an event loop. Flutter's event
loop is equivalent to Android's main `Looper`&mdash;that is, the `Looper` that
is attached to the main thread.

Dart's single-threaded model doesn't mean you need to run everything as a
blocking operation that causes the UI to freeze. Unlike Android, which
requires you to keep the main thread free at all times, in Flutter,
use the asynchronous facilities that the Dart language provides, such as
`async`/`await`, to perform asynchronous work. You might be familiar with
the `async`/`await` paradigm if you've used it in C#, Javascript, or if you
have used Kotlin's coroutines.

For example, you can run network code without causing the UI to hang by
using `async`/`await` and letting Dart do the heavy lifting:

<?code-excerpt "lib/async.dart (load-data)"?>
```dart
Future<void> loadData() async {
  var dataURL = Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
  setState(() {
    widgets = jsonDecode(response.body);
  });
}
```

Once the `await`ed network call is done, update the UI by calling `setState()`,
which triggers a rebuild of the widget subtree and updates the data.

The following example loads data asynchronously and displays it in a `ListView`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/async.dart"?>
```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(const SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleAppPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleAppPage> createState() => _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List widgets = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    loadData();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Sample App'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: widgets.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, position) {
          return getRow(position);
        },
      ),
    );
  }

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10),
      child: Text("Row ${widgets[i]["title"]}"),
    );
  }

  Future<void> loadData() async {
    var dataURL = Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
    setState(() {
      widgets = jsonDecode(response.body);
    });
  }
}
```

Refer to the next section for more information on doing work in the
background, and how Flutter differs from Android.

### How do you move work to a background thread?

In Android, when you want to access a network resource you would typically
move to a background thread and do the work, as to not block the main thread,
and avoid ANRs. For example, you might be using an `AsyncTask`, a `LiveData`,
an `IntentService`, a `JobScheduler` job, or an RxJava pipeline with a
scheduler that works on background threads.

Since Flutter is single threaded and runs an event loop (like Node.js), you
don't have to worry about thread management or spawning background threads. If
you're doing I/O-bound work, such as disk access or a network call, then
you can safely use `async`/`await` and you're all set. If, on the other
hand, you need to do computationally intensive work that keeps the CPU busy,
you want to move it to an `Isolate` to avoid blocking the event loop, like
you would keep _any_ sort of work out of the main thread in Android.

For I/O-bound work, declare the function as an `async` function,
and `await` on long-running tasks inside the function:

<?code-excerpt "lib/async.dart (load-data)"?>
```dart
Future<void> loadData() async {
  var dataURL = Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
  setState(() {
    widgets = jsonDecode(response.body);
  });
}
```

This is how you would typically do network or database calls, which are both
I/O operations.

On Android, when you extend `AsyncTask`, you typically override 3 methods,
`onPreExecute()`, `doInBackground()` and `onPostExecute()`. There is no
equivalent in Flutter, since you `await` on a long-running function, and
Dart's event loop takes care of the rest.

However, there are times when you might be processing a large amount of data and
your UI hangs. In Flutter, use `Isolate`s to take advantage of
multiple CPU cores to do long-running or computationally intensive tasks.

Isolates are separate execution threads that do not share any memory
with the main execution memory heap. This means you can't access variables from
the main thread, or update your UI by calling `setState()`.
Unlike Android threads,
Isolates are true to their name, and cannot share memory
(in the form of static fields, for example).

The following example shows, in a simple isolate, how to share data back to
the main thread to update the UI.

<?code-excerpt "lib/isolates.dart (load-data)"?>
```dart
Future<void> loadData() async {
  ReceivePort receivePort = ReceivePort();
  await Isolate.spawn(dataLoader, receivePort.sendPort);

  // The 'echo' isolate sends its SendPort as the first message.
  SendPort sendPort = await receivePort.first;

  final msg = await sendReceive(
    sendPort,
    'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',
  ) as List<Object?>;

  setState(() {
    widgets = msg;
  });
}

// The entry point for the isolate.
static Future<void> dataLoader(SendPort sendPort) async {
  // Open the ReceivePort for incoming messages.
  ReceivePort port = ReceivePort();

  // Notify any other isolates what port this isolate listens to.
  sendPort.send(port.sendPort);

  await for (var msg in port) {
    String data = msg[0];
    SendPort replyTo = msg[1];

    String dataURL = data;
    http.Response response = await http.get(Uri.parse(dataURL));
    // Lots of JSON to parse
    replyTo.send(jsonDecode(response.body));
  }
}

Future<Object?> sendReceive(SendPort port, Object? msg) {
  ReceivePort response = ReceivePort();
  port.send([msg, response.sendPort]);
  return response.first;
}
```

Here, `dataLoader()` is the `Isolate` that runs in its own separate
execution thread.  In the isolate you can perform more CPU intensive
processing (parsing a big JSON, for example),
or perform computationally intensive math,
such as encryption or signal processing.

You can run the full example below:

<?code-excerpt "lib/isolates.dart"?>
```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:isolate';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(const SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleAppPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleAppPage> createState() => _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List widgets = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    loadData();
  }

  Widget getBody() {
    bool showLoadingDialog = widgets.isEmpty;
    if (showLoadingDialog) {
      return getProgressDialog();
    } else {
      return getListView();
    }
  }

  Widget getProgressDialog() {
    return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Sample App'),
      ),
      body: getBody(),
    );
  }

  ListView getListView() {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: widgets.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, position) {
        return getRow(position);
      },
    );
  }

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10),
      child: Text("Row ${widgets[i]["title"]}"),
    );
  }

  Future<void> loadData() async {
    ReceivePort receivePort = ReceivePort();
    await Isolate.spawn(dataLoader, receivePort.sendPort);

    // The 'echo' isolate sends its SendPort as the first message.
    SendPort sendPort = await receivePort.first;

    final msg = await sendReceive(
      sendPort,
      'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',
    ) as List<Object?>;

    setState(() {
      widgets = msg;
    });
  }

  // The entry point for the isolate.
  static Future<void> dataLoader(SendPort sendPort) async {
    // Open the ReceivePort for incoming messages.
    ReceivePort port = ReceivePort();

    // Notify any other isolates what port this isolate listens to.
    sendPort.send(port.sendPort);

    await for (var msg in port) {
      String data = msg[0];
      SendPort replyTo = msg[1];

      String dataURL = data;
      http.Response response = await http.get(Uri.parse(dataURL));
      // Lots of JSON to parse
      replyTo.send(jsonDecode(response.body));
    }
  }

  Future<Object?> sendReceive(SendPort port, Object? msg) {
    ReceivePort response = ReceivePort();
    port.send([msg, response.sendPort]);
    return response.first;
  }
}
```

### What is the equivalent of OkHttp on Flutter?

Making a network call in Flutter is easy when you use the
popular [`http` package][].

While the http package doesn't have every feature found in OkHttp,
it abstracts away much of the networking that you would normally implement
yourself, making it a simple way to make network calls.

To add the `http` package as a dependency, run `flutter pub add`:

```console
$ flutter pub add http
```

To make a network call, call `await` on the `async` function `http.get()`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/network.dart"?>
```dart
import 'dart:developer' as developer;
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

Future<void> loadData() async {
  var dataURL = Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
  http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
  developer.log(response.body);
}
```

### How do I show the progress for a long-running task?

In Android you would typically show a `ProgressBar` view in your UI while
executing a long-running task on a background thread.

In Flutter, use a `ProgressIndicator` widget.
Show the progress programmatically by controlling when it's rendered
through a boolean flag. Tell Flutter to update its state before your
long-running task starts, and hide it after it ends.

In the following example, the build function is separated into three different
functions. If `showLoadingDialog` is `true` (when `widgets.isEmpty`),
then render the `ProgressIndicator`. Otherwise, render the
`ListView` with the data returned from a network call.

<?code-excerpt "lib/progress.dart"?>
```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() {
  runApp(const SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleAppPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleAppPage> createState() => _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List widgets = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    loadData();
  }

  Widget getBody() {
    bool showLoadingDialog = widgets.isEmpty;
    if (showLoadingDialog) {
      return getProgressDialog();
    } else {
      return getListView();
    }
  }

  Widget getProgressDialog() {
    return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Sample App'),
      ),
      body: getBody(),
    );
  }

  ListView getListView() {
    return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: widgets.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, position) {
        return getRow(position);
      },
    );
  }

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10),
      child: Text("Row ${widgets[i]["title"]}"),
    );
  }

  Future<void> loadData() async {
    var dataURL = Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    http.Response response = await http.get(dataURL);
    setState(() {
      widgets = jsonDecode(response.body);
    });
  }
}
```

## Project structure & resources

### Where do I store my resolution-dependent image files?

While Android treats resources and assets as distinct items,
Flutter apps have only assets. All resources that would live
in the `res/drawable-*` folders on Android,
are placed in an assets folder for Flutter.

Flutter follows a simple density-based format like iOS.
Assets might be `1.0x`, `2.0x`, `3.0x`, or any other multiplier.
Flutter doesn't have `dp`s but there are logical pixels,
which are basically the same as device-independent pixels.
Flutter's [`devicePixelRatio`][] expresses the ratio
of physical pixels in a single logical pixel.

The equivalent to Android's density buckets are:

 Android density qualifier | Flutter pixel ratio
 --- | ---
 `ldpi` | `0.75x`
 `mdpi` | `1.0x`
 `hdpi` | `1.5x`
 `xhdpi` | `2.0x`
 `xxhdpi` | `3.0x`
 `xxxhdpi` | `4.0x`

Assets are located in any arbitrary folder&mdash;Flutter
has no predefined folder structure.
You declare the assets (with location) in
the `pubspec.yaml` file, and Flutter picks them up.

Assets stored in the native asset folder are
accessed on the native side using Android's `AssetManager`:

```kotlin
val flutterAssetStream = assetManager.open("flutter_assets/assets/my_flutter_asset.png")
```

Flutter can't access native resources or assets.

To add a new image asset called `my_icon.png` to our Flutter project,
for example, and deciding that it should live in a folder we
arbitrarily called `images`, you would put the base image (1.0x)
in the `images` folder, and all the other variants in sub-folders
called with the appropriate ratio multiplier:

```plaintext
images/my_icon.png       // Base: 1.0x image
images/2.0x/my_icon.png  // 2.0x image
images/3.0x/my_icon.png  // 3.0x image
```

Next, you'll need to declare these images in your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
assets:
 - images/my_icon.jpeg
```

You can then access your images using `AssetImage`:

<?code-excerpt "lib/images.dart (asset-image)"?>
```dart
AssetImage('images/my_icon.jpeg')
```

or directly in an `Image` widget:

<?code-excerpt "lib/images.dart (image-asset)"?>
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Image.asset('images/my_image.png');
}
```

### Where do I store strings? How do I handle localization?

Flutter currently doesn't have a dedicated resources-like system for strings.
The best and recommended practice is to hold your strings in a `.arb` file as key-value pairs For example:

<?code-excerpt "lib/arb_examples.arb"?>
```json
{
   "@@locale": "en",
   "hello":"Hello {userName}",
   "@hello":{
      "description":"A message with a single parameter",
      "placeholders":{
         "userName":{
            "type":"String",
            "example":"Bob"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

Then in your code, you can access your strings as such:

<?code-excerpt "lib/localization_examples.dart (access-string)"?>
```dart
Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.hello('John'));
```

Flutter has basic support for accessibility on Android,
though this feature is a work in progress.

See [Internationalizing Flutter apps][] for more information on this.

### What is the equivalent of a Gradle file? How do I add dependencies?

In Android, you add dependencies by adding to your Gradle build script.
Flutter uses Dart's own build system, and the Pub package manager.
The tools delegate the building of the native Android and iOS
wrapper apps to the respective build systems.

While there are Gradle files under the `android` folder in your
Flutter project, only use these if you are adding native
dependencies needed for per-platform integration.
In general, use `pubspec.yaml` to declare
external dependencies to use in Flutter.
A good place to find Flutter packages is [pub.dev][].

## Activities and fragments

### What are the equivalent of activities and fragments in Flutter?

In Android, an `Activity` represents a single focused thing the user can do.
A `Fragment` represents a behavior or a portion of user interface.
Fragments are a way to modularize your code, compose sophisticated
user interfaces for larger screens, and help scale your application UI.
In Flutter, both of these concepts fall under the umbrella of `Widget`s.

To learn more about the UI for building Activities and Fragments,
see the community-contributed Medium article,
[Flutter for Android Developers: How to design Activity UI in Flutter][].

As mentioned in the [Intents][] section,
screens in Flutter are represented by `Widget`s since everything is
a widget in Flutter. Use a `Navigator` to move between different
`Route`s that represent different screens or pages,
or perhaps different states or renderings of the same data.

### How do I listen to Android activity lifecycle events?

In Android, you can override methods from the `Activity` to capture lifecycle
methods for the activity itself, or register `ActivityLifecycleCallbacks` on
the `Application`. In Flutter, you have neither concept, but you can instead
listen to lifecycle events by hooking into the `WidgetsBinding` observer and
listening to the `didChangeAppLifecycleState()` change event.

The observable lifecycle events are:

* `detached` — The application is still hosted on a flutter engine but is detached from any host views.
* `inactive` — The application is in an inactive state and is not receiving user
  input.
* `paused` — The application is not currently visible to the user,
  not responding to user input, and running in the background.
  This is equivalent to `onPause()` in Android.
* `resumed` — The application is visible and responding to user input.
  This is equivalent to `onPostResume()` in Android.

For more details on the meaning of these states, see the
[`AppLifecycleStatus` documentation][].

As you might have noticed, only a small minority of the Activity
lifecycle events are available; while `FlutterActivity` does
capture almost all the activity lifecycle events internally and
send them over to the Flutter engine, they're mostly shielded
away from you. Flutter takes care of starting and stopping the
engine for you, and there is little reason for needing to
observe the activity lifecycle on the Flutter side in most cases.
If you need to observe the lifecycle to acquire or release any
native resources, you should likely be doing it from the native side,
at any rate.

Here's an example of how to observe the lifecycle status of the
containing activity:

<?code-excerpt "lib/lifecycle.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

class LifecycleWatcher extends StatefulWidget {
  const LifecycleWatcher({super.key});

  @override
  State<LifecycleWatcher> createState() => _LifecycleWatcherState();
}

class _LifecycleWatcherState extends State<LifecycleWatcher>
    with WidgetsBindingObserver {
  AppLifecycleState? _lastLifecycleState;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
    setState(() {
      _lastLifecycleState = state;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    if (_lastLifecycleState == null) {
      return const Text(
        'This widget has not observed any lifecycle changes.',
        textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
      );
    }

    return Text(
      'The most recent lifecycle state this widget observed was: $_lastLifecycleState.',
      textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
    );
  }
}

void main() {
  runApp(const Center(child: LifecycleWatcher()));
}
```

## Layouts

### What is the equivalent of a LinearLayout?

In Android, a LinearLayout is used to lay your widgets out
linearly&mdash;either horizontally or vertically.
In Flutter, use the Row or Column
widgets to achieve the same result.

If you notice the two code samples are identical with the exception of the
"Row" and "Column" widget. The children are the same and this feature can be
exploited to develop rich layouts that can change overtime with the same
children.

<?code-excerpt "lib/layout.dart (row)"?>
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return const Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
    children: <Widget>[
      Text('Row One'),
      Text('Row Two'),
      Text('Row Three'),
      Text('Row Four'),
    ],
  );
}
```

<?code-excerpt "lib/layout.dart (column)"?>
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return const Column(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
    children: <Widget>[
      Text('Column One'),
      Text('Column Two'),
      Text('Column Three'),
      Text('Column Four'),
    ],
  );
}
```

To learn more about building linear layouts,
see the community-contributed Medium article
[Flutter for Android Developers: How to design LinearLayout in Flutter][].

### What is the equivalent of a RelativeLayout?

A RelativeLayout lays your widgets out relative to each other. In
Flutter, there are a few ways to achieve the same result.

You can achieve the result of a RelativeLayout by using a combination of
Column, Row, and Stack widgets. You can specify rules for the widgets
constructors on how the children are laid out relative to the parent.

For a good example of building a RelativeLayout in Flutter,
see Collin's answer on [StackOverflow][].

### What is the equivalent of a ScrollView?

In Android, use a ScrollView to lay out your widgets&mdash;if the user's
device has a smaller screen than your content, it scrolls.

In Flutter, the easiest way to do this is using the ListView widget.
This might seem like overkill coming from Android,
but in Flutter a ListView widget is
both a ScrollView and an Android ListView.

<?code-excerpt "lib/layout.dart (list-view)"?>
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ListView(
    children: const <Widget>[
      Text('Row One'),
      Text('Row Two'),
      Text('Row Three'),
      Text('Row Four'),
    ],
  );
}
```

### How do I handle landscape transitions in Flutter?

FlutterView handles the config change if AndroidManifest.xml contains:

```yaml
android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize"
```

## Gesture detection and touch event handling

### How do I add an onClick listener to a widget in Flutter?

In Android, you can attach onClick to views such as button by calling
the method 'setOnClickListener'.

In Flutter there are two ways of adding touch listeners:

 1. If the Widget supports event detection, pass a function to it and handle it
    in the function. For example, the ElevatedButton has an `onPressed` parameter:

  <?code-excerpt "lib/events.dart (on-pressed)"?>
  ```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        developer.log('click');
      },
      child: const Text('Button'),
    );
  }
  ```

 2. If the Widget doesn't support event detection, wrap the
    widget in a GestureDetector and pass a function to the `onTap` parameter.

  <?code-excerpt "lib/events.dart (on-tap)"?>
  ```dart
  class SampleTapApp extends StatelessWidget {
    const SampleTapApp({super.key});
  
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: GestureDetector(
            onTap: () {
              developer.log('tap');
            },
            child: const FlutterLogo(
              size: 200,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

### How do I handle other gestures on widgets?

Using the GestureDetector, you can listen to a wide range of Gestures such as:

* Tap

  * `onTapDown` - A pointer that might cause a tap has contacted the screen at a
     particular location.
  * `onTapUp` - A pointer that triggers a tap has stopped contacting the
     screen at a particular location.
  * `onTap` - A tap has occurred.
  * `onTapCancel` - The pointer that previously triggered the `onTapDown` won't
     cause a tap.

* Double tap

  * `onDoubleTap` - The user tapped the screen at the same location twice in
     quick succession.

* Long press

  * `onLongPress` - A pointer has remained in contact with the screen at
    the same location for a long period of time.

* Vertical drag

  * `onVerticalDragStart` - A pointer has contacted the screen and
    might begin to move vertically.
  * `onVerticalDragUpdate` - A pointer in contact with the screen
    has moved further in the vertical direction.
  * `onVerticalDragEnd` - A pointer that was previously in contact with the
    screen and moving vertically is no longer in contact with the screen and was
    moving at a specific velocity when it stopped contacting the screen.

* Horizontal drag

  * `onHorizontalDragStart` - A pointer has contacted the screen and might begin
    to move horizontally.
  * `onHorizontalDragUpdate` - A pointer in contact with the screen
    has moved further in the horizontal direction.
  * `onHorizontalDragEnd` - A pointer that was previously in contact with the
    screen and moving horizontally is no longer in contact with the
    screen and was moving at a specific velocity when it stopped
    contacting the screen.

The following example shows a `GestureDetector`
that rotates the Flutter logo on a double tap:

<?code-excerpt "lib/events.dart (sample-app)"?>
```dart
class SampleApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleApp> createState() => _SampleAppState();
}

class _SampleAppState extends State<SampleApp>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController controller;
  late CurvedAnimation curve;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    controller = AnimationController(
      vsync: this,
      duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 2000),
    );
    curve = CurvedAnimation(
      parent: controller,
      curve: Curves.easeIn,
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: GestureDetector(
          onDoubleTap: () {
            if (controller.isCompleted) {
              controller.reverse();
            } else {
              controller.forward();
            }
          },
          child: RotationTransition(
            turns: curve,
            child: const FlutterLogo(
              size: 200,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Listviews & adapters

### What is the alternative to a ListView in Flutter?

The equivalent to a ListView in Flutter is … a ListView!

In an Android ListView, you create an adapter and pass it into the
ListView, which renders each row with what your adapter returns. However, you
have to make sure you recycle your rows, otherwise, you get all sorts of crazy
visual glitches and memory issues.

Due to Flutter's immutable widget pattern, you pass a list of
widgets to your ListView, and Flutter takes care of making sure
that scrolling is fast and smooth.

<?code-excerpt "lib/listview.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleAppPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleAppPage> createState() => _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Sample App'),
      ),
      body: ListView(children: _getListData()),
    );
  }

  List<Widget> _getListData() {
    List<Widget> widgets = [];
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      widgets.add(Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10),
        child: Text('Row $i'),
      ));
    }
    return widgets;
  }
}
```

### How do I know which list item is clicked on?

In Android, the ListView has a method to find out which item was clicked,
'onItemClickListener'.
In Flutter, use the touch handling provided by the passed-in widgets.

<?code-excerpt "lib/list_item_tapped.dart"?>
```dart
import 'dart:developer' as developer;

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleAppPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleAppPage> createState() => _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Sample App'),
      ),
      body: ListView(children: _getListData()),
    );
  }

  List<Widget> _getListData() {
    List<Widget> widgets = [];
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      widgets.add(
        GestureDetector(
          onTap: () {
            developer.log('row tapped');
          },
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10),
            child: Text('Row $i'),
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
    return widgets;
  }
}
```

### How do I update ListView's dynamically?

On Android, you update the adapter and call `notifyDataSetChanged`.

In Flutter, if you were to update the list of widgets inside a `setState()`,
you would quickly see that your data did not change visually.
This is because when `setState()` is called, the Flutter rendering engine
looks at the widget tree to see if anything has changed. When it gets to your
`ListView`, it performs a `==` check, and determines that the two
`ListView`s are the same. Nothing has changed, so no update is required.

For a simple way to update your `ListView`, create a new `List` inside of
`setState()`, and copy the data from the old list to the new list.
While this approach is simple, it is not recommended for large data sets,
as shown in the next example.

<?code-excerpt "lib/listview_dynamic.dart"?>
```dart
import 'dart:developer' as developer;

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleAppPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleAppPage> createState() => _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List<Widget> widgets = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      widgets.add(getRow(i));
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Sample App'),
      ),
      body: ListView(children: widgets),
    );
  }

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: () {
        setState(() {
          widgets = List.from(widgets);
          widgets.add(getRow(widgets.length));
          developer.log('row $i');
        });
      },
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10),
        child: Text('Row $i'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The recommended, efficient, and effective way to build a list uses a
`ListView.Builder`. This method is great when you have a dynamic
`List` or a `List` with very large amounts of data. This is essentially
the equivalent of RecyclerView on Android, which automatically
recycles list elements for you:

<?code-excerpt "lib/listview_builder.dart"?>
```dart
import 'dart:developer' as developer;

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleAppPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleAppPage> createState() => _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  List<Widget> widgets = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      widgets.add(getRow(i));
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Sample App'),
      ),
      body: ListView.builder(
        itemCount: widgets.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, position) {
          return getRow(position);
        },
      ),
    );
  }

  Widget getRow(int i) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: () {
        setState(() {
          widgets.add(getRow(widgets.length));
          developer.log('row $i');
        });
      },
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10),
        child: Text('Row $i'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Instead of creating a "ListView", create a
`ListView.builder` that takes two key parameters: the
initial length of the list, and an `ItemBuilder` function.

The `ItemBuilder` function is similar to the `getView`
function in an Android adapter; it takes a position,
and returns the row you want rendered at that position.

Finally, but most importantly, notice that the `onTap()` function
doesn't recreate the list anymore, but instead `.add`s to it.

## Working with text

### How do I set custom fonts on my Text widgets?

In Android SDK (as of Android O), you create a Font resource file and
pass it into the FontFamily param for your TextView.

In Flutter, place the font file in a folder and reference it in the
`pubspec.yaml` file, similar to how you import images.

```yaml
fonts:
   - family: MyCustomFont
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/MyCustomFont.ttf
       - style: italic
```

Then assign the font to your `Text` widget:

<?code-excerpt "lib/text.dart (custom-font)"?>
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: const Text('Sample App'),
    ),
    body: const Center(
      child: Text(
        'This is a custom font text',
        style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'MyCustomFont'),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

### How do I style my Text widgets?

Along with fonts, you can customize other styling elements on a `Text` widget.
The style parameter of a `Text` widget takes a `TextStyle` object, where you can
customize many parameters, such as:

* color
* decoration
* decorationColor
* decorationStyle
* fontFamily
* fontSize
* fontStyle
* fontWeight
* hashCode
* height
* inherit
* letterSpacing
* textBaseline
* wordSpacing

## Form input

For more information on using Forms,
see [Retrieve the value of a text field][],
from the [Flutter cookbook][].

### What is the equivalent of a "hint" on an Input?

In Flutter, you can easily show a "hint" or a placeholder text for your input by
adding an InputDecoration object to the decoration constructor parameter for
the Text Widget.

<?code-excerpt "lib/form.dart (input-hint)" replace="/return const //g;/;//g"?>
```dart
Center(
  child: TextField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(hintText: 'This is a hint'),
  ),
)
```

### How do I show validation errors?

Just as you would with a "hint", pass an InputDecoration object
to the decoration constructor for the Text widget.

However, you don't want to start off by showing an error.
Instead, when the user has entered invalid data,
update the state, and pass a new `InputDecoration` object.

<?code-excerpt "lib/validation_errors.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const SampleApp());
}

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}

class SampleAppPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const SampleAppPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<SampleAppPage> createState() => _SampleAppPageState();
}

class _SampleAppPageState extends State<SampleAppPage> {
  String? _errorText;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Sample App'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: TextField(
          onSubmitted: (text) {
            setState(() {
              if (!isEmail(text)) {
                _errorText = 'Error: This is not an email';
              } else {
                _errorText = null;
              }
            });
          },
          decoration: InputDecoration(
            hintText: 'This is a hint',
            errorText: _getErrorText(),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  String? _getErrorText() {
    return _errorText;
  }

  bool isEmail(String em) {
    String emailRegexp =
        r'^(([^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+(\.[^<>()[\]\\.,;:\s@\"]+)*)|'
        r'(\".+\"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|'
        r'(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$';

    RegExp regExp = RegExp(emailRegexp);

    return regExp.hasMatch(em);
  }
}
```


## Flutter plugins

### How do I access the GPS sensor?

Use the [`geolocator`][] community plugin.

### How do I access the camera?

The [`image_picker`][] plugin is popular
for accessing the camera.

### How do I log in with Facebook?

To Log in with Facebook, use the
[`flutter_facebook_login`][] community plugin.

### How do I use Firebase features?

Most Firebase functions are covered by
[first party plugins][].
These plugins are first-party integrations,
maintained by the Flutter team:

 * [`google_mobile_ads`][] for Google Mobile Ads for Flutter
 * [`firebase_analytics`][] for Firebase Analytics
 * [`firebase_auth`][] for Firebase Auth
 * [`firebase_database`][] for Firebase RTDB
 * [`firebase_storage`][] for Firebase Cloud Storage
 * [`firebase_messaging`][] for Firebase Messaging (FCM)
 * [`flutter_firebase_ui`][] for quick Firebase Auth integrations
   (Facebook, Google, Twitter and email)
 * [`cloud_firestore`][] for Firebase Cloud Firestore

You can also find some third-party Firebase plugins on
pub.dev that cover areas not directly covered by the
first-party plugins.

### How do I build my own custom native integrations?

If there is platform-specific functionality that Flutter
or its community Plugins are missing,
you can build your own following the
[developing packages and plugins][] page.

Flutter's plugin architecture, in a nutshell, is much like using an Event bus in
Android: you fire off a message and let the receiver process and emit a result
back to you. In this case, the receiver is code running on the native side
on Android or iOS.

### How do I use the NDK in my Flutter application?

If you use the NDK in your current Android application and want your Flutter
application to take advantage of your native libraries then it's possible by
building a custom plugin.

Your custom plugin first talks to your Android app, where you call your
`native` functions over JNI. Once a response is ready,
send a message back to Flutter and render the result.

Calling native code directly from Flutter is currently not supported.

## Themes

### How do I theme my app?

Out of the box, Flutter comes with a beautiful implementation of Material
Design, which takes care of a lot of styling and theming needs that you would
typically do. Unlike Android where you declare themes in XML and then assign it
to your application using AndroidManifest.xml, in Flutter you declare themes
in the top level widget.

To take full advantage of Material Components in your app, you can declare a top
level widget `MaterialApp` as the entry point to your application. MaterialApp
is a convenience widget that wraps a number of widgets that are commonly
required for applications implementing Material Design.
It builds upon a WidgetsApp by adding Material specific functionality.

You can also use a `WidgetsApp` as your app widget, which provides some of the
same functionality, but is not as rich as `MaterialApp`.

To customize the colors and styles of any child components, pass a
`ThemeData` object to the `MaterialApp` widget. For example, in the code below,
the color scheme from seed is set to deepPurple and text selection color is red.

<?code-excerpt "lib/theme.dart (theme)"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class SampleApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const SampleApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sample App',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
        textSelectionTheme:
            const TextSelectionThemeData(selectionColor: Colors.red),
      ),
      home: const SampleAppPage(),
    );
  }
}
```


## Databases and local storage

### How do I access Shared Preferences?

In Android, you can store a small collection of key-value pairs using
the SharedPreferences API.

In Flutter, access this functionality using the
[Shared_Preferences plugin][].
This plugin wraps the functionality of both
Shared Preferences and NSUserDefaults (the iOS equivalent).

<?code-excerpt "lib/shared_prefs.dart"?>
```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    const MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _incrementCounter,
            child: Text('Increment Counter'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}

Future<void> _incrementCounter() async {
  SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  int counter = (prefs.getInt('counter') ?? 0) + 1;
  await prefs.setInt('counter', counter);
}
```

### How do I access SQLite in Flutter?

In Android, you use SQLite to store structured data
that you can query using SQL.

In Flutter, for macOS, Android, or iOS,
access this functionality using the
[SQFlite][] plugin.

## Debugging

### What tools can I use to debug my app in Flutter?

Use the [DevTools][] suite for debugging Flutter or Dart apps.

DevTools includes support for profiling, examining the heap,
inspecting the widget tree, logging diagnostics, debugging,
observing executed lines of code, debugging memory leaks and memory
fragmentation. For more information, check out the
[DevTools][] documentation.

## Notifications

### How do I set up push notifications?

In Android, you use Firebase Cloud Messaging to set up
push notifications for your app.

In Flutter, access this functionality using the
[Firebase Messaging][] plugin.
For more information on using the Firebase Cloud Messaging API,
see the [`firebase_messaging`][] plugin documentation.
