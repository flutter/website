## For new Flutter developers

If you're brand new to Flutter,
we suggest you complete the following resources
in order:

 1. [Dart language overview][]
    Flutter uses the Dart language.
    If you have experience with other
    object-oriented languages, like Java, C++, or
    Swift, Dart should feel familiar to you,
    and you might be comfortable skipping this section.
 2. [Write your first Flutter app][]
    This codelab introduces the basics of Flutter
    by creating an app that works on mobile,
    desktop, and web.
 3. [Learn the fundamentals][]
    This is an opinionated set of documentation for
    the new Flutter developer. It guides you
    through some of the most important pieces of
    building Flutter applications.

## Apply your existing knowledge

* [Flutter for Android developers][]
* [Flutter for SwiftUI developers][]
