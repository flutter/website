To get started with Flutter,
you need to have some familiarity with the Dart programming language, which Flutter
applications are written in, and widgets,
which are the building blocks of Flutter UI.
Both will be introduced on this page, but you'll continue
learning about each throughout this series.
Additional resources are listed throughout this page,
but you do not need to be an expert in either
subject in order to continue.

## Widgets

In regard to Flutter, you'll often hear
"everything is a widget".
Widgets are the building blocks of a
Flutter app's user interface,
and each widget is an immutable declaration of part
of the user interface. Widgets are used
to describe all aspects of a user interface,
including physical aspects such as text and buttons to
lay out effects like padding and alignment.

Widgets form a hierarchy based on composition.
Each widget nests inside its parent and
can receive context from the parent.
This structure carries all the way up to the root
widget, as this trivial example shows:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp( // Root widget
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('My Home Page'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Builder(
            builder: (context) {
              return Column(
                children: [
                  const Text('Hello, World!'),
                  const SizedBox(height: 20),
                  ElevatedButton(
                    onPressed: () {
                      print('Click!');
                    },
                    child: const Text('A button'),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In the preceding code,
all instantiated classes are widgets:
`MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `Text`,
`Center`, `Builder`, `Column`, `SizedBox`, and
`ElevatedButton`.

### Widget composition

As mentioned, Flutter emphasizes widgets as a unit
of composition. Widgets are typically composed of
many other small, single-purpose widgets that
combine to produce powerful effects.

There are layout widgets such
as `Padding`, `Alignment`, `Row`, `Column`,
and `Grid`. These layout widgets do not have a
visual representation of their own.
Instead, their sole purpose is to
control some aspect of another widget's layout.
Flutter also includes utility widgets that
take advantage of this compositional approach.
For example, `Container`, a commonly used widget,
is made up of several widgets responsible for layout,
painting, positioning, and sizing.
Some widgets have visual representation,
such as `ElevatedButton` and
`Text` in the preceding example, as well as
widgets like `Icon` and `Image`.

If you run the code from the preceding example,
Flutter paints a button with the text
"Hello, World!" centered on the screen, laid out vertically.
To position these elements, there's a `Center` widget,
which positions its children in the center
of the available space, and a `Column` widget,
which lays out its children vertically one after another.

In the [next page][] in this series, you will
learn more about layout in Flutter.

### Building widgets

To create a user interface in Flutter,
you override the [`build`][] method on widget objects.
All widgets must have a build method,
and it must return another widget. For example,
if you want to add text to the screen with some padding,
you could write it like this:

```dart
class PaddedText extends StatelessWidget {
  const PaddedText({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Padding(
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
      child: const Text('Hello, World!'),
    );
  }
}
```

The framework calls the `build` method when this
widget is created and when the dependencies of this
widget change (such as state that is passed into the widget).
This method can potentially be called in every frame
and should not have any side effects beyond
building a widget.
To learn more about how Flutter renders widgets,
check out the [Flutter architectural overview][].

### Widget state

The framework introduces two major classes of widget:
stateful and stateless widgets.

Widgets that have no mutable state
(they have no class properties
that change over time) subclass [`StatelessWidget`][].
Many built-in widgets are stateless,
such as `Padding`, `Text`, and `Icon`.
When you create your own widgets,
you'll create `Stateless` widgets most of the time.

On the other hand,
if the unique characteristics of a widget need to change
based on user interaction or other factors,
that widget is stateful.
For example, if a widget has a counter that
increments whenever the user taps a button,
then the value of the counter is the state for that widget.
When that value changes, the widget needs to be
rebuilt to update its part of the UI.
These widgets subclass [`StatefulWidget`][],
and (because the widget itself is immutable)
they store mutable state in a separate class that
subclasses [`State`][].
`StatefulWidgets` don't have a `build` method;
instead, their user interface is built through
their `State` object, as shown in the example below.

```dart
class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<CounterWidget> createState() => _CounterWidgetState();
}

class _CounterWidgetState extends State<CounterWidget> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text('$_counter');
  }
}
```

Whenever you mutate a `State` object
(for example, by incrementing the counter),
you must call [`setState`][] to signal the framework
to update the user interface by
calling the `State`'s `build` method again.

Separating state from widget objects
lets other widgets treat both
stateless and stateful widgets in exactly the same way,
without being concerned about losing state.
Instead of needing to hold on to
a child to preserve its state,
the parent can create a new instance of the child
at any time without losing
the child's persistent state.
The framework does all the work of finding and
reusing existing state objects when appropriate.

There's more information about
[`StatefulWidget`][] objects later in this
series, in the [state management lesson][].

## Important widgets to know

The Flutter SDK includes many built-in widgets,
from the smallest pieces of UI, like `Text`,
to layout widgets, and widgets that style
your application. The following widgets are
the most important to be aware of as you move onto the
next lesson in the learning pathway.

* [`Container`][]
* [`Text`][]
* [`Scaffold`][]
* [`AppBar`][]
* [`Row`][] and [`Column`][]
* [`ElevatedButton`][]
* [`Image`][]
* [`Icon`][]
