Given that Flutter is a UI toolkit,
you'll spend a lot of time creating layouts
with Flutter widgets. In this section,
you'll learn how to build layouts with some of the
most common layout widgets.
You'll use Flutter DevTools (also
called Dart DevTools) to understand how
Flutter is creating your layout.
Finally, you'll encounter and debug one of
Flutter's most common layout errors,
the dreaded "unbounded constraints" error.

## Understanding layout in Flutter

The core of Flutter's layout mechanism is widgets. 
In Flutter, almost everything is a widget — even 
layout models are widgets. 
The images, icons, and text that you see in a 
Flutter app are all widgets. 
Things you don't see are also widgets, 
such as the rows, columns, and grids that arrange,
constrain, and align the visible widgets.

You create a layout by composing widgets to 
build more complex widgets. For example, 
the diagram below shows 3 icons with a label under
each one, and the corresponding widget tree:

<img src='/assets/images/docs/fwe/layout/simple_row_column_widget_tree.png' alt="A diagram that shows widget composition with a series of lines and nodes.">

In this example, there's a row of 3 columns where 
each column contains an icon and a label. 
All layouts, no matter how complex, 
are created by composing these layout widgets.

### Constraints

Understanding constraints in Flutter is an
important part of understanding
how layout works in Flutter.

Layout, in a general sense, refers to the size of 
the widgets and their positions on the screen. 
The size and position of any given widget is 
constrained by its parent; 
it can't have any size it wants, 
and it doesn't decide its own place on the screen.
Instead, size and position are determined by 
a conversation between a widget and its parent.

In the simplest example, 
the layout conversation looks like this:

 1. A widget receives its constraints from its parent. 
 2. A constraint is just a set of 4 doubles: 
    a minimum and maximum width, 
    and a minimum and maximum height. 
 3. The widget determines what size it should be
    within those constraints, and passes its
    width and height back to the parent. 
 4. The parent looks at the size it wants to be and
    how it should be aligned, 
    and sets the widget's position accordingly. 
    Alignment can be set explicitly, 
    using a variety of widgets like `Center`, 
    and the alignment properties on `Row` and `Column`.

In Flutter, this layout conversation is often 
expressed with the simplified phrase, 
"Constraints go down. Sizes go up. 
Parent sets the position."

### Box types

In Flutter, widgets are rendered by their 
underlying [`RenderBox`][] objects. 
These objects determine how to handle the
constraints they're passed.

Generally, there are three kinds of boxes:
* Those that try to be as big as possible. 
For example, the boxes used by 
[`Center`][] and [`ListView`][]. 
* Those that try to be the same size as their
children. For example, the boxes used by 
[`Transform`][] and [`Opacity`][]
* Those that try to be a particular size.
For example, the boxes used by 
[`Image`][] and [`Text`][].

Some widgets, for example [`Container`][], 
vary from type to type based on their 
constructor arguments. 
The `Container` constructor defaults to trying to
be as big as possible, but if you give it a width,
for instance, it tries to honor that and 
be that particular size.

Others, for example [`Row`][] and [`Column`][] (flex boxes) 
vary based on the constraints they are given. 
Read more about flex boxes and constraints in
the [Understanding Constraints article][].

## Lay out a single widget

To lay out a single widget in Flutter, 
wrap a visible widget, 
such as `Text` or `Image` with a widget that 
can change its position on a screen, 
such as a `Center` widget.

:::note Note
The examples on the page use a widget called 
`BorderedImage`. This is a custom widget, 
and is used here to hide
the code that isn't relevant to this topic.
:::

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Center(
    child: BorderedImage(),
  );
}
```

The following figure shows a widget that isn't 
aligned on the left, 
and a widget that has been centered on the right.

<img src='/assets/images/docs/fwe/layout/center.png' alt="A screenshot of a centered widget and a screenshot of a widget that hasn't been centered.">

All layout widgets have either of the following:
* A `child` property if they take a single 
child—for example, `Center`, `Container`,
or `Padding`.
* A `children` property if they take a list 
of widgets—for example, 
`Row`, `Column`, `ListView`, or `Stack`.

### Container

`Container` is a convenience widget that's 
made up of several widgets responsible for layout,
painting, positioning, and sizing. 
In regard to layout, 
it can be used to add padding and 
margins to a widget. 
There is also a `Padding` widget
that could be used here to the same effect. 
The following example uses a `Container`.

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Container(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
    child: BorderedImage(),
  );
}
```

The following figure shows a widget without 
padding on the left, 
and a widget with padding on the right.

<img src='/assets/images/docs/fwe/layout/padding.png' alt="A screenshot of a widget with padding and a screenshot of a widget without padding.">

To create more complex layouts in Flutter, 
you can compose many widgets. 
For example, you can combine `Container` and `Center`:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Center(
    Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
      child: BorderedImage(),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Layout multiple widgets vertically or horizontally

One of the most common layout patterns is to 
arrange widgets vertically or horizontally. 
You can use a `Row` widget to arrange widgets 
horizontally, 
and a `Column` widget to arrange widgets vertically. 
The first figure on this page used both.

This is the most basic example of using a `Row` widget.

{% render docs/code-and-image.md, 
image:"fwe/layout/row.png", 
caption: "This figure shows a row widget with three children."
alt: "A screenshot of a row widget with three children"
code:"
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Row(
    children: [
      BorderedImage(),
      BorderedImage(),
      BorderedImage(),
    ],
  );
}
```
" %}

Each child of `Row` or `Column` can be 
rows and columns themselves, 
combining to make a complex layout.
For example, you could add labels to each 
of the images in the example above using columns.


{% render docs/code-and-image.md,
image:"fwe/layout/nested_row_column.png",
caption: "This figure shows a row widget with three children, each of which is a column."
alt: "A screenshot of a row of three widgets, each of which has a label underneath it."
code:"
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Row(
    children: [
      Column(
        children: [
          BorderedImage(),
          Text('Dash 1'),
        ],
      ),
      Column(
        children: [
          BorderedImage(),
          Text('Dash 2'),
        ],
      ),
      Column(
        children: [
          BorderedImage(),
          Text('Dash 3'),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```
" %}


### Align widgets within rows and columns

In the following example, 
the widgets are each 200 pixels wide, 
and the viewport is 700 pixels wide. 
The widgets are consequently aligned to the left, 
one after the other, 
with all the extra space on the right.

<img src='/assets/images/docs/fwe/layout/left_alignment.png' alt="A diagram that shows three widgets laid out in a row. Each child widget is labeled as 200px wide, and the blank space on the right is labeled as 100px wide.">

You control how a row or column aligns its
children using the `mainAxisAlignment` and 
`crossAxisAlignment` properties.
For a row, the main axis runs horizontally and 
the cross axis runs vertically. For a column, 
the main axis runs
vertically and the cross axis runs horizontally.

<img src='/assets/images/docs/fwe/layout/axes_diagram.png' alt="A diagram that shows the direction of the main axis and cross axis in both rows and columns">

Setting the main axis alignment to `spaceEvenly` 
divides the free horizontal space evenly between,
before, and after each image.

{% render docs/code-and-image.md,
image:"fwe/layout/space_evenly.png",
caption: "This figure shows a row widget with three children, which are aligned with the MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly constant."
alt: "A screenshot of three widgets, spaced evenly from each other."
code:"
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Row(
    [!mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly!],
    children: [
      BorderedImage(),
      BorderedImage(),
      BorderedImage(),
    ],
  );
}
```
" %}

Columns work the same way as rows. 
The following example shows a column of 3 images, 
each is 100 pixels high. The height of the 
render box (in this case, the entire screen) 
is more than 300 pixels, 
so setting the main axis alignment to `spaceEvenly` 
divides the free vertical space evenly between,
above, and below each image.

<img src='/assets/images/docs/fwe/layout/col_space_evenly.png' alt="A screenshot of a three widgets laid out vertically, using a column widget.">

The [`MainAxisAlignment`][] and [`CrossAxisAlignment`][] 
enums offer a variety of constants for 
controlling alignment.

Flutter includes other widgets that can be used 
for alignment, notably the `Align` widget.

### Sizing widgets within rows and columns

When a layout is too large to fit a device, 
a yellow and black striped pattern appears 
along the affected edge. 
In this example, the viewport is 400 pixels wide,
and each child is 150 pixels wide.

<img src='/assets/images/docs/fwe/layout/overflowing_row.png' alt="A screenshot of a row of widgets that are wider than their viewport.">

Widgets can be sized to fit within a 
row or column by using the `Expanded` widget. 
To fix the previous example where the row of 
images is too wide for its render box, 
wrap each image with an [`Expanded`][] widget.

{% render docs/code-and-image.md,
image:"fwe/layout/expanded_row.png",
caption: "This figure shows a row widget with three children that are wrapped with `Expanded` widgets."
alt: "A screenshot of three widgets, which take up exactly the amount of space available on the main axis. All three widgets are equal width."
code:"
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return const Row(
    children: [
      [!Expanded!](
        child: BorderedImage(width: 150, height: 150),
      ),
      [!Expanded!](
        child: BorderedImage(width: 150, height: 150),
      ),
      [!Expanded!](
        child: BorderedImage(width: 150, height: 150),
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```
" %}

The `Expanded` widget can also dictate how much 
space a widget should take up relative
to its siblings. For example,
perhaps you want a widget to occupy twice 
as much space as its siblings. 
For this, use the `Expanded` widgets `flex` property, 
an integer that determines the flex factor 
for a widget. The default flex factor is 1. 
The following code sets the flex factor of the
middle image to 2:

{% render docs/code-and-image.md,
image:"fwe/layout/flex_2_row.png",
caption: "This figure shows a row widget with three children which are wrapped with `Expanded` widgets. The center child has it's `flex` property set to 2."
alt: "A screenshot of three widgets, which take up exactly the amount of space available on the main axis. The widget in the center is twice as wide as the widgets on the left and right."
code:"
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return const Row(
    children: [
      Expanded(
        child: BorderedImage(width: 150, height: 150),
      ),
      Expanded(
        [!flex: 2!],
        child: BorderedImage(width: 150, height: 150),
      ),
      Expanded(
        child: BorderedImage(width: 150, height: 150),
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```
" %}

## DevTools and debugging layout

In certain situations, 
a box's constraint is unbounded, or infinite. 
This means that either the maximum width or the
maximum height is set to [`double.infinity`][]. 
A box that tries to be as big as possible won't
function usefully when given an 
unbounded constraint and, in debug mode, 
throws an exception.

The most common case where a render box ends up
with an unbounded constraint is within a 
flex box ([`Row`][] or [`Column`][]), 
and within a scrollable region 
(such as [`ListView`][] and other [`ScrollView`][] subclasses). 
`ListView`, for example, tries to expand to
fit the space available in its cross-direction 
(perhaps it's a vertically-scrolling
block and tries to be as wide as its parent). 
If you nest a vertically scrolling `ListView`
inside a horizontally scrolling `ListView`,
the inner list tries to be as wide as possible, 
which is infinitely wide, since the outer one is
scrollable in that direction.

Perhaps the most common error you'll run into 
while building a Flutter application is due to 
incorrectly using layout widgets, 
and is referred to as the "unbounded constraints" 
error.

If there was only one type error you should be 
prepared to confront when you first start building
Flutter apps, it would be this one.

:::note The Widget inspector
Flutter has a robust suite of DevTools that
help you work with any number of aspects of
Flutter development.
The "Widget Inspector" tool is particularly
useful when building and debugging layouts (and working with widgets in general).

##  Scrolling widgets

Flutter has many built-in widgets that
automatically scroll and also offers a variety of
widgets that you can customize to
create specific scrolling behavior.
On this page, you'll see how to use the most common widget for
making any page scrollable,
as well as a widget for creating scrollable lists.

### ListView

`ListView` is a column-like widget that 
automatically provides scrolling when its 
content is longer than its render box.
The most basic way to use a `ListView` is 
very similar to using a `Column` or `Row`. 
Unlike a column or row, 
a `ListView` requires its children to take up 
all the available space on the cross axis, 
as shown in the example below. 

{% render docs/code-and-image.md,
image:"fwe/layout/basic_listview.png",
caption: "This figure shows a ListView widget with three children."
alt: "A screenshot of three widgets laid out vertically. They have expanded to take up all available space on the cross axis."
code:"
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return [!ListView!](
    children: const [
      BorderedImage(),
      BorderedImage(),
      BorderedImage(),
    ],
  );
}
```
" %}

`ListView`s are commonly used when you have an 
unknown or very large (or infinite) number of list items. 
When this is the case, 
it's best to use the `ListView.builder` constructor. 
The builder constructor only builds the 
children that are currently visible on screen.

In the following example, 
the `ListView` is displaying a list of to-do items. 
The todo items are being fetched from a repository, 
and therefore the number of todos is unknown.


{% render docs/code-and-image.md,
image:"fwe/layout/listview_builder.png",
caption: "This figure shows the ListView.builder constructor to display an unknown number of children."
alt: "A screenshot of several widgets laid out vertically. They have expanded to take up all available space on the cross axis."
code:"
```dart
final List<ToDo> items = Repository.fetchTodos();

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ListView.builder(
    itemCount: items.length,
    itemBuilder: (context, idx) {
      var item = items[idx];
      return Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        child: Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
          children: [
            Text(item.description),
            Text(item.isComplete),
          ],
        ),
      );
    },
  );
}
```
" %}

## Adaptive layouts

Because Flutter is used to create mobile,
tablet, desktop, _and_ web apps,
it's likely you'll need to adjust your
application to behave differently depending on
things like screen size or input device.
This is referred to as making an app
_adaptive_ and _responsive_.

One of the most useful widgets in making 
adaptive layouts is the [`LayoutBuilder`][] widget. 
`LayoutBuilder` is one of many widgets that uses
the "builder" pattern in Flutter.

### The builder pattern

In Flutter, you'll find several widgets that use 
the word "builder" in their names or 
in their constructors. 
The following list isn't exhaustive:

* [`ListView.builder`][]
* [`GridView.builder`][]
* [`Builder`][]
* [`LayoutBuilder`][]
* [`FutureBuilder`][]

These different "builders" are useful for solving 
different problems. For example, 
the `ListView.builder` constructor is primarily used
to lazily render items in a list, 
while the `Builder` widget is useful for gaining 
access to the `BuildContext` in deeply widget code.

Despite their different use cases, 
these builders are unified by how they work. 
Builder widgets and builder constructors all have 
arguments called 'builder' 
(or something similar, 
like `itemBuilder` in the case of `ListView.builder`), 
and the builder argument always accepts a
callback. 
This callback is a __builder function__. 
Builder functions are callbacks that pass data to
the parent widget, 
and the parent widget uses those arguments to 
build and return the child widget.
Builder functions always pass in at least
one argument–the build context–
and generally at least one other argument.

For example, the `LayoutBuilder` widget is used 
to create responsive layouts based 
on the size of the viewport. The builder callback
body is passed the [`BoxConstraints`][] that it receives
from its parent, along with the widgets 'BuildContext'. 
With these constraints, you can return a different
widget based on the available space.

{% ytEmbed 'IYDVcriKjsw', 'LayoutBuilder (Flutter Widget of the Week)' %}

In the following example, 
the widget returned by the `LayoutBuilder` 
changes based on whether the viewport is 
less than or equal 600 pixels,
or greater than 600 pixels.


{% render docs/code-and-image.md,
image:"fwe/layout/layout_builder.png",
caption: "This figure shows a narrow layout, which lays out its children vertically, and a wider layout, which lays out its children in a grid."
alt: "Two screenshots, in which one shows a narrow layout and the other shows a wide layout."
code:"
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return LayoutBuilder(
    builder: (BuildContext context, BoxConstraints constraints) {
      [!if (constraints.maxWidth <= 600)!] {
        return _MobileLayout();
      } else {
        return _DesktopLayout();
      }
    },
  );
}
```
" %}

Meanwhile, the `itemBuilder` callback on the 
`ListView.builder` constructor is passed the 
build context and an `int`.
This callback is called once for every item 
in the list, 
and the int argument represents the index of the list item. 
The first time the itemBuilder callback is called 
when Flutter is building the UI, 
the int passed to the function is 0, 
the second time it's 1, and so on.

This allows you to provide specific configuration 
based on the index. Recall the example above using
the`ListView.builder` constructor:

```dart
final List<ToDo> items = Repository.fetchTodos();

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ListView.builder(
    itemCount: items.length,
    itemBuilder: (context, idx) {
      var item = items[idx];
      return Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        child: Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
          children: [
            Text(item.description),
            Text(item.isComplete),
          ],
        ),
      );
    },
  );
}
```

This example code uses the index that's 
passed into the builder to grab the correct 
todo from the list of items, 
and then displays that todo's data in 
the widget that is returned from the builder.

To exemplify this, 
the following example changes the 
background color of every other list item.

{% render docs/code-and-image.md,
image:"fwe/layout/alternating_list_items.png"
caption:"This figure shows a `ListView`, in which its children have alternating background colors. The background colors were determined programmatically based on the index of the child within the `ListView`."
code:"
```dart
final List<ToDo> items = Repository.fetchTodos();

Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ListView.builder(
    itemCount: items.length,
    itemBuilder: (context, idx) {
      var item = items[idx];
      return Container(
        [!color: idx % 2 == 0 ? Colors.lightBlue : Colors.transparent!],
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
        child: Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
          children: [
            Text(item.description),
            Text(item.isComplete),
          ],
        ),
      );
    },
  );
}
```
