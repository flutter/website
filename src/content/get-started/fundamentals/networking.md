While it's said that "no man is an island",
a Flutter app without any networking capability
can feel a tad disconnected.
This page covers how to add networking features
to your Flutter app. Your app will retrieve data,
parse JSON into usable in memory representations,
and then send data out again.

## Introduction to retrieving data over the network

At it's simplest, assuming you utilize the [`http`][]
package to adapt to the differences between network access
from Dart VM based platforms and web browser-based environments,
making a HTTP `GET` request can be as simple as the following:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void main() async {
  var response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/1'),
  );
  print(response.body);
}
```

The following two tutorials show you all of the details
involved in adding the [`http`][] package to your app,
whether you are running on Android,
iOS, inside a web browser, or natively on Windows,
macOS, or Linux.
The first tutorial shows you how to make an
unauthenticated `GET` request to a website,
parse the retrieved data as `JSON` and then
display the resulting data. The second tutorial
builds on the first by adding authentication headers,
enabling access to web servers requiring authorization.
The article by the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)
gives more background on how authorization works on the web.

* Tutorial: [Make authenticated requests][]

## Making data retrieved from the network useful

Once you retrieve data from the network,
you need a way to convert the data from the network
into something that you can easily work with in Dart.
The tutorials in the previous section used hand rolled Dart
to convert network data into an in-memory representation.
In this section,
you'll see other options for handling this conversion.
The first links to a YouTube video showing an overview
of the [`freezed` package][].
The second links to a codelab that covers patterns
and records using a case study of parsing JSON.

## Going both ways, getting data out again

Now that you've mastered the art of retrieving data,
it's time to look at pushing data out.
This information starts with sending data to the network,
but then dives into asynchronicity. The truth is,
once you are in a conversation over the network,
you'll need to deal with the fact that web servers
that are physically far away can take a while to respond,
and you can't stop rendering to the screen
while you wait for packets to round trip.
Dart has great support for asynchronicity,
as does Flutter.
You'll learn all about Dart's support in a tutorial,
then see Flutter's capability covered in a
Widget of the Week video.
Once you complete that, you'll learn how to debug
network traffic using DevTool's Network View.

## Extension material

Now that you've mastered using Flutter's networking APIs,
it helps to see Flutter's network usage in context.
The first codelab (ostensibly on creating Adaptive apps in Flutter),
uses a web server written in Dart to work around the web browsers'
[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions][].

Next, a long-form YouTube video where
Flutter DevRel alumnus, Fitz,
talks about how the location of data matters for Flutter apps.
Finally, a really useful series of articles by Flutter GDE
Anna (Domashych) Leushchenko covering advanced networking in Flutter.
