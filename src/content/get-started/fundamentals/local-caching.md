Now that you've learned about how to load data from servers
over the network, your Flutter app should feel more alive.
However, just because you *can* load data from remote servers
doesn't mean you always *should*. Sometimes, it's better to
re-render the data you received from the previous network
request rather than repeat it and make your user wait until
it completes again. This technique of retaining application
data to show again at a future time is called *caching*, and
this page covers how to approach this task in your Flutter app.

## Introduction to caching

At its most basic, all caching strategies amount to the same
three-step operation, represented with the following pseudocode:

```dart
Data? _cachedData;

Future<Data> get data async {
    // Step 1: Check whether your cache already contains the desired data
    if (_cachedData == null) {
        // Step 2: Load the data if the cache was empty
        _cachedData = await _readData();
    }
    // Step 3: Return the value in the cache
    return _cachedData!;
}
```

There are many interesting ways to vary this strategy,
including the location of the cache, the extent to which you
preemptively write values to, or "warm", the cache; and others.

## Common caching terminology

Caching comes with its own terminology, some of which is
defined and explained below.

**Cache hit**
: An app is said to have had a cache hit when the cache already
  contained their desired information and loading it from the
  real source of truth was unnecessary.

**Cache miss**
: An app is said to have had a cache miss when the cache was
  empty and the desired data is loaded from the real source
  of truth, and then saved to the cache for future reads.

## Risks of caching data

An app is said to have a **stale cache** when the data within 
the source of truth has changed, which puts the app at risk
of rendering old, outdated information.

All caching strategies run the risk of holding onto stale data.
Unfortunately, the action of verifying the freshness of a cache
often takes as much time to complete as fully loading the data
in question. This means that most apps tend to only benefit
from caching data if they trust the data to be fresh at runtime
without verification.

To deal with this, most caching systems include a time limit
on any individual piece of cached data. After this time limit
is exceeded, would-be cache hits are treated as cache misses
until fresh data is loaded.

A popular joke among computer scientists is that "The two
hardest things in computer science are cache invalidation,
naming things, and off-by-one errors." ðŸ˜„

Despite the risks, almost every app in the world makes heavy
use of data caching. The rest of this page explores multiple
approaches to caching data in your Flutter app, but know that
all of these approaches can be tweaked or combined for your
situation.

## Caching data in local memory

The simplest and most performant caching strategy is an
in-memory cache. The downside of this strategy is that,
because the cache is only held in system memory, no data is
retained beyond the session in which it is originally cached.
(Of course, this "downside" also has the upside of automatically
solving most stale cache problems!)

Due to their simplicity, in-memory caches closely mimic
the pseudocode seen above. That said, it is best to use proven
design principles, like the [repository pattern][],
to organize your code and prevent cache checks like the above
from appearing all over your code base.

Imagine a `UserRepository` class that is also tasked with
caching users in memory to avoid duplicate network requests.
Its implementation might look like this:

```dart
class UserRepository {
  UserRepository(this.api);
  
  final Api api;
  final Map<int, User?> _userCache = {};

  Future<User?> loadUser(int id) async {
    if (!_userCache.containsKey(id)) {
      final response = await api.get(id);
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        _userCache[id] = User.fromJson(response.body);
      } else {
        _userCache[id] = null;
      }
    }
    return _userCache[id];
  }
}
```

This `UserRepository` follows multiple proven design
principles including:

* [dependency injection][], which helps with testing
* [loose coupling][], which protects surrounding code from
its implementation details, and
* [separation of concerns][], which prevents its implementation
from juggling too many concerns.

And best of all, no matter how many times within a single session
a user visits pages in your Flutter app that load a given user,
the `UserRepository` class only loads that data over the network *once*.

However, your users might eventually tire of waiting for data
to load every time they relaunch your app. For that, you should
choose from one of the persistent caching strategies found below.

## Persistent caches

Caching data in memory will never see your precious cache
outlive a single user session.
To enjoy the performance benefits of cache hits on fresh
launches of your application, you need to cache data somewhere
on the device's hard drive.

### Caching data with `shared_preferences`

[`shared_preferences`][] is a Flutter plugin that wraps
platform-specific [key-value storage][] on all six of Flutter's
target platforms.
Although these underlying platform key-value stores were designed
for small data sizes, they are still suitable for a caching
strategy for most applications.
For a complete guide, see our other resources on using key-value stores.

### Caching data with the file system

If your Flutter app outgrows the low-throughput scenarios
ideal for `shared_preferences`, you might be ready to explore
caching data with your device's file system.
For a more thorough guide, see our other resources on
file system caching.

### Caching data with an on-device database

The final boss of local data caching is any strategy
that uses a proper database to read and write data.
Multiple flavors exist, including relational and
non-relational databases.
All approaches offer dramatically improved performance over
simple files - especially for large datasets.
For a more thorough guide, see the following resources:

## Caching images

Caching images is a similar problem space to caching regular data,
though with a one-size-fits-all solution.
To direct your Flutter app to use the file system to store images,
use the [`cached_network_image` package][].

## State restoration

Along with application data, you might also want to persist other
aspects of a user's session, like their navigation stack, scroll
positions, and even partial progress filling out forms. This
pattern is called "state restoration", and is built in to Flutter.

State restoration works by instructing the Flutter framework
to sync data from its Element tree with the Flutter engine,
which then caches it in platform-specific storage for future 
sessions. To enable state restoration on Flutter for Android
and iOS, see the following documentation:

* Android documentation: [Android state restoration][]
* iOS documentation: [iOS state restoration][]

[iOS state restoration]: /platform-integration/ios/restore-state-ios
