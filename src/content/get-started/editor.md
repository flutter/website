You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor or
integrated development environment (IDE)
combined with Flutter's command-line tools.
The Flutter team recommends using an editor that supports
a Flutter extension or plugin, like VS Code and Android Studio.
These plugins provide code completion, syntax highlighting,
widget editing assists, run & debug support, and more.

You can add a supported plugin for Visual Studio Code,
Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA Community, Educational,
and Ultimate editions.
The [Flutter plugin][] _only_ works with
Android Studio and the listed editions of IntelliJ IDEA.

(The [Dart plugin][] supports eight additional JetBrains IDEs.)

[Flutter plugin]: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter
[Dart plugin]: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart

Follow these procedures to add the Flutter plugin to VS Code,
Android Studio, or IntelliJ.

If you choose another IDE, skip ahead
to [Write your first Flutter app][].

Flutter apps.
