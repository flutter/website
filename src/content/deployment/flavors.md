This guide shows you how to create Flutter flavors for an
Android app.

## Overview

A Flutter flavor when used with Android represents a unified
term for various platform-specific features. For example, a
flavor could determine which icon, app name, API key,
feature flag, and logging level is associated with a
specific version of your app.

If you want to create Flutter flavors for an Android app,
you can do this in Flutter. In Android, a Flutter flavor is
referred to as a [_product flavor_][].

The following illustrates an example of the Android
[_build variants_] that are created when an Android app has
two product flavors (`staging`, `production`) and two build
types (`debug`, `release`):

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Configure your product flavors {: #using-flavors-in-android }

Complete the following steps to add two Android product
flavors called `staging` and `production` to a new Flutter
project called `flavors_example`, and then test your project
to make sure that the flavors work as expected.

1.  Create a new Flutter project called `flavors_example`
    with Kotlin as the preferred Android language. By
    default, the project includes the `debug` and
    `release` Android build types.

    ```console title="console"
    $ flutter create --android-language kotlin flavors_example
    ```

1.  Add the product flavors called `staging` and
    `production` to the `flavors_example` project.

    * In the `flavors_example` project, navigate to the
      `android/app/` directory and open `build.gradle.kts`.

    * Add the `flavorsDimension` property and the
      `productFlavors` properties inside of the
      `android {} block`. Make sure that the `android {}`
      block also contains the default
      `debug` and `release` build types:

      ```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
      android {
          ...
          buildTypes {
            getByName("debug") {...}
            getByName("release") {...}
          }
          ...
          flavorDimensions += "default"
          productFlavors {
              create("staging") {
                  dimension = "default"
                  applicationIdSuffix = ".staging"
              }
              create("production") {
                  dimension = "default"
                  applicationIdSuffix = ".production"
              }
          }
      }
      ```

1.  To make sure that you've set up everything correctly,
    run your app on the Android product flavors. You won't
    see any differences because the configuration settings
    haven't changed, but you do want to make sure that the
    app can run.

    * Start an Android emulator or connect a physical device
      with developer options enabled.

    * In the console, navigate to the `flavors_example`
      directory and enter the following command to test the
      `staging` flavor:

      ```console title="console"
      $ flutter run --flavor staging
      ```

    * Repeat the previous step for the `production` flavor.

1.  If everything runs, you're ready to customize your
    configurations. For more information, see
    [Customize configurations][].

[Customize configurations]: #customize-configurations

## Launch a flavor {: #launching-your-app-flavors }

After you've created the product flavors for an Android app,
you can launch a specific product flavor through Flutter.

You can launch a product flavor with the Flutter CLI using
the following steps:

1.  Start an Android emulator or connect a physical device
    with developer options enabled.

1.  In the console, navigate to the `flavors_example`
    directory and enter the following command:

    ```console title="console"
    $ flutter (run | build) --flavor <flavor_name>
    ```

    * `(run |  build)`: Replace this with one of the
      following:
      * `run`: Run the app in debug mode.
      * `build`: Run the app in production mode.

    * `<flavor_name>`: Replace this with the name of your
      Android product flavor (for example, `staging` or
      `production`).

    Example:

    ```console title="console"
    $ flutter run --flavor staging
    ```

## Customize configurations

After you've added product flavors, you can customize them
for your Android app.

### Create a distinct app display name

If you have multiple product flavors, a distinct app name
can quickly identify which flavor your deployed app is
using.

![Distinct app names in menu](/assets/images/docs/flavors/flavors-android-app-names-1.png){:width="40%"}

The following steps show how to add distinct app display
names for two product flavors called `staging` and
`production` in a project called `flavors_example`.

1.  Update `build.gradle.kts` in your IDE:

    * In the `flavors_example` project, navigate to the
      `android/app/` directory and open `build.gradle.kts`.

    * In the `flavorsDimension` block, add a `resValue()`
      property called `app_name` to the `staging` and
      `production` flavors:

      ```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
      android {
          ...
          flavorDimensions += "default"
          productFlavors {
              create("staging") {
                  dimension = "default"
                  resValue(
                      type = "string",
                      name = "app_name",
                      value = "Flavors staging")
                  applicationIdSuffix = ".staging"
              }
              create("production") {
                  dimension = "default"
                  resValue(
                      type = "string",
                      name = "app_name",
                      value = "Flavors production")
                  applicationIdSuffix = ".production"
              }
          }
      ```

1.  Update `AndroidManifest.xml` in your IDE:

    * In the `flavors_example` project, navigate to
      `android/app/src/main` and open `AndroidManifest.xml`.

    * Replace the value for `android:label` with
      `@string/app_name`.

      ```xml title="AndroidManifest.xml"
      <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
          <application
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            ...
          />
      />
      ```

1.  Launch the app for each product flavor (`staging`,
    `production`) and check to make sure that the
    app display name has changed for each.

    * To launch a product flavor, see the steps in
      [Launch a flavor][].

    * In the Android App Emulator, go to the list of apps.
      You should see one for `Flavors p...` and
      `Flavors s...`.

    * To see more information for `Flavors p...` or
      `Flavors s...`, long-press the icon for one of them
      and and select `App info`.

### Create distinct icons

If you have multiple product flavors, a distinct icon for
each configuration can help you quickly identify which
flavor your deployed app is using.

![Distinct icons](/assets/images/docs/flavors/flavors-android-icons.png){:width="40%"}

The following steps show how to add a distinct icon for two
product flavors called `staging` and `production` in a
project called `flavors_example`. 

1.  Prepare your icons:

    * Design your `staging` icon and `production` icon in
      the design tool of your choice.

    * Generate versions of the `staging` icon and
      `production` icon in the following sizes and them in
      `PNG` format:

      * mipmap-mdpi (48x48 pixels)
      * mipmap-hdpi (72x72 pixels)
      * mipmap-xhdpi (96x96 pixels)
      * mipmap-xxhdpi (144x144 pixels)
      * mipmap-xxxhdpi (192x192 pixels)

    :::note
    You can use a tool like [App Icon Generator][]
    to generate the versions of your icons.
    :::

1.  Create flavor-specific resource directories:

    * Navigate to the `android/app/src` directory.

    * Create a directory called `staging/res`.

    * Navigate to the `staging/res` directory.

    * Create the following `mipmap` directories and move the
      versions of the `staging` icon into them:

      * `mipmap-mdpi/48x48_staging.png`
      * `mipmap-hdpi/72x72_staging.png`
      * `mipmap-xhdpi/96x96_staging.png`
      * `mipmap-xxhdpi/144x144_staging.png`
      * `mipmap-xxxhdpi/192x192_staging.png`

    * Repeat the previous steps for the `production` flavor
      directories and icons.

    * Rename all of the icons to `ic_launcher.png`.

1.  Double-check the configurations in `AndroidManifest.xml`
    in your IDE:

    * In the `flavors_example` project, navigate to
      `android/app/src/main` and open `AndroidManifest.xml`.

    * Make sure that the value for `android:icon` is
      `@mipmap/ic_launcher`.

1.  Launch the app for each product flavor (`staging`,
    `production`) and check to make sure that the app icon
    has changed for each. To launch a product flavor, see
    the steps in [Launch a flavor][].

### Add unique build settings

If you have additional build settings that you would like to
configure for a specific Android product flavor, see
Android's [Configure build variants][].
