<?code-excerpt path-base="data-and-backend/json/"?>

It is hard to think of a mobile app that doesn't need to communicate with a
web server or easily store structured data at some point. When making
network-connected apps, the chances are that it needs to consume some good old
JSON, sooner or later.

This guide looks into ways of using JSON with Flutter.
It covers which JSON solution to use in different scenarios, and why.

:::note Terminology
_Encoding_ and _serialization_ are the same
thing&mdash;turning a data structure into a string.
_Decoding_ and _deserialization_ are the
opposite process&mdash;turning a string into a data structure.
However, _serialization_ also commonly refers to the entire process of
translating data structures to and from a more easily readable format.

To avoid confusion, this doc uses "serialization" when referring to the
overall process, and "encoding" and "decoding" when specifically
referring to those processes.

## Which JSON serialization method is right for me?

This article covers two general strategies for working with JSON:

* Manual serialization
* Automated serialization using code generation

Different projects come with different complexities and use cases.
For smaller proof-of-concept projects or quick prototypes,
using code generators might be overkill.
For apps with several JSON models with more complexity,
encoding by hand can quickly become tedious, repetitive,
and lend itself to many small errors.

### Use manual serialization for smaller projects

Manual JSON decoding refers to using the built-in JSON decoder in
`dart:convert`. It involves passing the raw JSON string to the `jsonDecode()`
function, and then looking up the values you need in the resulting
`Map<String, dynamic>`.
It has no external dependencies or particular setup process,
and it's good for a quick proof of concept.

Manual decoding does not perform well when your project becomes bigger.
Writing decoding logic by hand can become hard to manage and error-prone.
If you have a typo when accessing a nonexistent JSON
field, your code throws an error during runtime.

If you do not have many JSON models in your project and are
looking to test a concept quickly,
manual serialization might be the way you want to start.
For an example of manual encoding, see
[Serializing JSON manually using dart:convert][].

### Use code generation for medium to large projects

JSON serialization with code generation means having an external library
generate the encoding boilerplate for you. After some initial setup,
you run a file watcher that generates the code from your model classes.
For example, [`json_serializable`][] and [`built_value`][] are these
kinds of libraries.

This approach scales well for a larger project. No hand-written
boilerplate is needed, and typos when accessing JSON fields are caught at
compile-time. The downside with code generation is that it requires some
initial setup. Also, the generated source files might produce visual clutter
in your project navigator.

You might want to use generated code for JSON serialization when you have a
medium or a larger project. To see an example of code generation based JSON
encoding, see [Serializing JSON using code generation libraries][].

## Is there a GSON/<wbr>Jackson/<wbr>Moshi equivalent in Flutter?

The simple answer is no.

Such a library would require using runtime [reflection][], which is disabled in
Flutter. Runtime reflection interferes with [tree shaking][], which Dart has
supported for quite a long time. With tree shaking, you can "shake off" unused
code from your release builds. This optimizes the app's size significantly.

Since reflection makes all code implicitly used by default, it makes tree
shaking difficult. The tools cannot know what parts are unused at runtime, so
the redundant code is hard to strip away. App sizes cannot be easily optimized
when using reflection.

Although you cannot use runtime reflection with Flutter,
some libraries give you similarly easy-to-use APIs but are
based on code generation instead. This
approach is covered in more detail in the
[code generation libraries][] section.

## Serializing JSON manually using dart:convert

Basic JSON serialization in Flutter is very simple. Flutter has a built-in
`dart:convert` library that includes a straightforward JSON encoder and
decoder.

The following sample JSON implements a simple user model.

<?code-excerpt "lib/manual/main.dart (multiline-json)" skip="1" take="4"?>
```json
{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

With `dart:convert`,
you can serialize this JSON model in two ways.

### Serializing JSON inline

By looking at the [`dart:convert`][] documentation,
you'll see that you can decode the JSON by calling the
`jsonDecode()` function, with the JSON string as the method argument.

<?code-excerpt "lib/manual/main.dart (manual)"?>
```dart
final user = jsonDecode(jsonString) as Map<String, dynamic>;

print('Howdy, ${user['name']}!');
print('We sent the verification link to ${user['email']}.');
```

Unfortunately, `jsonDecode()` returns a `dynamic`, meaning
that you do not know the types of the values until runtime. With this approach,
you lose most of the statically typed language features: type safety,
autocompletion and most importantly, compile-time exceptions. Your code will
become instantly more error-prone.

For example, whenever you access the `name` or `email` fields, you could quickly
introduce a typo. A typo that the compiler doesn't know about since the
JSON lives in a map structure.

### Serializing JSON inside model classes

Combat the previously mentioned problems by introducing a plain model
class, called `User` in this example. Inside the `User` class, you'll find:

* A `User.fromJson()` constructor, for constructing a new `User` instance from a
  map structure.
* A `toJson()` method, which converts a `User` instance into a map.

With this approach, the _calling code_ can have type safety,
autocompletion for the `name` and `email` fields, and compile-time exceptions.
If you make typos or treat the fields as `int`s instead of `String`s,
the app won't compile, instead of crashing at runtime.

**user.dart**

<?code-excerpt "lib/manual/user.dart"?>
```dart
class User {
  final String name;
  final String email;

  User(this.name, this.email);

  User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json)
    : name = json['name'] as String,
      email = json['email'] as String;

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {'name': name, 'email': email};
}
```

The responsibility of the decoding logic is now moved inside the model
itself. With this new approach, you can decode a user easily.

<?code-excerpt "lib/manual/main.dart (from-json)"?>
```dart
final userMap = jsonDecode(jsonString) as Map<String, dynamic>;
final user = User.fromJson(userMap);

print('Howdy, ${user.name}!');
print('We sent the verification link to ${user.email}.');
```

To encode a user, pass the `User` object to the `jsonEncode()` function.
You don't need to call the `toJson()` method, since `jsonEncode()`
already does it for you.

<?code-excerpt "lib/manual/main.dart (json-encode)" skip="1"?>
```dart
String json = jsonEncode(user);
```

With this approach, the calling code doesn't have to worry about JSON
serialization at all. However, the model class still definitely has to.
In a production app, you would want to ensure that the serialization
works properly. In practice, the `User.fromJson()` and `User.toJson()`
methods both need to have unit tests in place to verify correct behavior.

:::note
The cookbook contains [a more comprehensive worked example of using
JSON model classes][json background parsing], using an isolate to parse
the JSON file on a background thread. This approach is ideal if you
need your app to remain responsive while the JSON file is being
decoded.
:::

However, real-world scenarios are not always that simple.
Sometimes JSON API responses are more complex, for example since they 
contain nested JSON objects that must be parsed through their own model
class.

It would be nice if there were something that handled the JSON encoding
and decoding for you.  Luckily, there is!

## Serializing JSON using code generation libraries

Although there are other libraries available, this guide uses
[`json_serializable`][], an automated source code generator that
generates the JSON serialization boilerplate for you.

:::note Choosing a library
You might have noticed two [Flutter Favorite][] packages
on pub.dev that generate JSON serialization code,
[`json_serializable`][] and [`built_value`][].
How do you choose between these packages?
The `json_serializable` package allows you to make regular
classes serializable by using annotations, 
whereas the `built_value` package provides a higher-level way
of defining immutable value classes that can also be
serialized to JSON.
:::

Since the serialization code is not handwritten or maintained manually
anymore, you minimize the risk of having JSON serialization exceptions at
runtime.

### Setting up json_serializable in a project

To include `json_serializable` in your project, you need one regular
dependency, and two _dev dependencies_. In short, _dev dependencies_
are dependencies that are not included in our app source code&mdash;they
are only used in the development environment.

To add the dependencies, run `flutter pub add`:

```console
$ flutter pub add json_annotation dev:build_runner dev:json_serializable
```

Run `flutter pub get` inside your project root folder
(or click **Packages get** in your editor)
to make these new dependencies available in your project.

### Creating model classes the json_serializable way

The following shows how to convert the `User` class to a
`json_serializable` class. For the sake of simplicity,
this code uses the simplified JSON model
from the previous samples.

**user.dart**

<?code-excerpt "lib/serializable/user.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';

/// This allows the `User` class to access private members in
/// the generated file. The value for this is *.g.dart, where
/// the star denotes the source file name.
part 'user.g.dart';

/// An annotation for the code generator to know that this class needs the
/// JSON serialization logic to be generated.
@JsonSerializable()
class User {
  User(this.name, this.email);

  String name;
  String email;

  /// A necessary factory constructor for creating a new User instance
  /// from a map. Pass the map to the generated `_$UserFromJson()` constructor.
  /// The constructor is named after the source class, in this case, User.
  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);

  /// `toJson` is the convention for a class to declare support for serialization
  /// to JSON. The implementation simply calls the private, generated
  /// helper method `_$UserToJson`.
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$UserToJson(this);
}
```

With this setup, the source code generator generates code for encoding
and decoding the `name` and `email` fields from JSON.

If needed, it is also easy to customize the naming strategy.
For example, if the API returns objects with _snake\_case_,
and you want to use _lowerCamelCase_ in your models,
you can use the `@JsonKey` annotation with a name parameter:

```dart
/// Tell json_serializable that "registration_date_millis" should be
/// mapped to this property.
@JsonKey(name: 'registration_date_millis')
final int registrationDateMillis;
```

It's best if both server and client follow the same naming strategy.  
`@JsonSerializable()` provides `fieldRename` enum for totally converting dart 
fields into JSON keys.

Modifying `@JsonSerializable(fieldRename: FieldRename.snake)` is equivalent to
adding `@JsonKey(name: '<snake_case>')` to each field.

Sometimes server data is uncertain, so it is necessary to verify and protect data
 on client.  
Other commonly used `@JsonKey` annotations include: 

```dart
/// Tell json_serializable to use "defaultValue" if the JSON doesn't
/// contain this key or if the value is `null`.
@JsonKey(defaultValue: false)
final bool isAdult;

/// When `true` tell json_serializable that JSON must contain the key, 
/// If the key doesn't exist, an exception is thrown.
@JsonKey(required: true)
final String id;

/// When `true` tell json_serializable that generated code should 
/// ignore this field completely. 
@JsonKey(ignore: true)
final String verificationCode;
```

### Running the code generation utility

When creating `json_serializable` classes the first time,
you'll get errors similar to what is shown in the image below.

![IDE warning when the generated code for a model class does not exist yet.](/assets/images/docs/json/ide_warning.png)

These errors are entirely normal and are simply because the generated code for
the model class does not exist yet. To resolve this, run the code
generator that generates the serialization boilerplate.

There are two ways of running the code generator.

#### One-time code generation

By running `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` in the project root,
you generate JSON serialization code for your models whenever they are needed.
This triggers a one-time build that goes through the source files, picks the
relevant ones, and generates the necessary serialization code for them.

While this is convenient, it would be nice if you did not have to run the
build manually every time you make changes in your model classes.

#### Generating code continuously

A _watcher_ makes our source code generation process more convenient. It
watches changes in our project files and automatically builds the necessary
files when needed. Start the watcher by running
`dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs` in the project root.

It is safe to start the watcher once and leave it running in the background.

### Consuming json_serializable models

To decode a JSON string the `json_serializable` way,
you do not have actually to make any changes to our previous code.

<?code-excerpt "lib/serializable/main.dart (from-json)"?>
```dart
final userMap = jsonDecode(jsonString) as Map<String, dynamic>;
final user = User.fromJson(userMap);
```
The same goes for encoding. The calling API is the same as before.

<?code-excerpt "lib/serializable/main.dart (json-encode)" skip="1"?>
```dart
String json = jsonEncode(user);
```

With `json_serializable`,
you can forget any manual JSON serialization in the `User` class.
The source code generator creates a file called `user.g.dart`,
that has all the necessary serialization logic.
You no longer have to write automated tests to ensure
that the serialization works&mdash;it's now
_the library's responsibility_ to make sure the serialization works
appropriately.

## Generating code for nested classes

You might have code that has nested classes within a class.
If that is the case, and you have tried to pass the class in JSON format
as an argument to a service (such as Firebase, for example),
you might have experienced an `Invalid argument` error.

Consider the following `Address` class:

<?code-excerpt "lib/nested/address.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';
part 'address.g.dart';

@JsonSerializable()
class Address {
  String street;
  String city;

  Address(this.street, this.city);

  factory Address.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>
      _$AddressFromJson(json);
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$AddressToJson(this);
}
```

The `Address` class is nested inside the `User` class:

<?code-excerpt "lib/nested/user.dart" replace="/explicitToJson: true//g"?>
```dart
import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';

import 'address.dart';

part 'user.g.dart';

@JsonSerializable()
class User {
  User(this.name, this.address);

  String name;
  Address address;

  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$UserToJson(this);
}
```

Running 
`dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
in the terminal creates
the `*.g.dart` file, but the private `_$UserToJson()` function
looks something like the following:

```dart
Map<String, dynamic> _$UserToJson(User instance) => <String, dynamic>{
  'name': instance.name,
  'address': instance.address,
};
```

All looks fine now, but if you do a print() on the user object:

<?code-excerpt "lib/nested/main.dart (print)"?>
```dart
Address address = Address('My st.', 'New York');
User user = User('John', address);
print(user.toJson());
```

The result is:

```json
{name: John, address: Instance of 'address'}
```

When what you probably want is output like the following:

```json
{name: John, address: {street: My st., city: New York}}
```

To make this work, pass `explicitToJson: true` in the `@JsonSerializable()`
annotation over the class declaration. The `User` class now looks as follows:

<?code-excerpt "lib/nested/user.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';

import 'address.dart';

part 'user.g.dart';

@JsonSerializable(explicitToJson: true)
class User {
  User(this.name, this.address);

  String name;
  Address address;

  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$UserToJson(this);
}
```

[`JsonSerializable`][] class for the [`json_annotation`][] package.
