State management is a complex topic.
If you feel that some of your questions haven't been answered,
or that the approach described on these pages
is not viable for your use cases, you are probably right.

Learn more at the following links,
many of which have been contributed by the Flutter community:

## setState

The low-level approach to use for widget-specific, ephemeral state.

## ValueNotifier &amp; InheritedNotifier

An approach using only Flutter provided tooling to update state and notify the UI of changes.


* [State Management using ValueNotifier and InheritedNotifier][], by Tadas Petra

[State Management using ValueNotifier and InheritedNotifier]: https://www.hungrimind.com/articles/flutter-state-management

## InheritedWidget &amp; InheritedModel

The low-level approach used to communicate between ancestors and children
in the widget tree. This is what `provider` and many other approaches
use under the hood.

The following instructor-led video workshop covers how to
use `InheritedWidget`:

## GetIt

A service locator based state management approach that
doesn't need a `BuildContext`.

  It can also be used together with BloCs.
* [GetIt Mixin package][], a mixin that completes
  `GetIt` to a full state management solution.
* [GetIt Hooks package][], same as the mixin in
  case you already use `flutter_hooks`.

features, including examples/frameworks,
small kernel, and many ready-to-use decoupled features
such as debugging, logging, auth, redux, locator,
particle system and more.

## Flutter Commands

Reactive state management that uses the Command Pattern
and is based on `ValueNotifiers`. Best in combination with
[GetIt](#getit), but can be used with `Provider` or other
locators too.

* [Flutter Command package][]
* [RxCommand package][], `Stream` based implementation.

dependency injection solution and an integrated router.

## Triple Pattern (Segmented State Pattern)

Triple is a pattern for state management that uses `Streams` or `ValueNotifier`.
This mechanism (nicknamed _triple_ because the stream always uses three
values: `Error`, `Loading`, and `State`), is based on the
[Segmented State pattern][].

## flutter_reactive_value

The `flutter_reactive_value` library might offer the least complex solution for state
management in Flutter. It might help Flutter newcomers add reactivity to their UI,
without the complexity of the mechanisms described before.
The `flutter_reactive_value` library defines the `reactiveValue(BuildContext)`
extension method on `ValueNotifier`. This extension allows a `Widget` to
fetch the current value of the `ValueNotifier` and
subscribe the `Widget` to changes in the value of the `ValueNotifier`.
If the value of the `ValueNotifier` changes, `Widget` rebuilds.
