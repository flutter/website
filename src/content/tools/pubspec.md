title: "Flutter pubspec options"
description: "Describes the Flutter-only fields in the pubspec file."
---

This page is primarily aimed at folks who write
Flutter apps. If you write packages or plugins, 
(perhaps you want to create a federated plugin),
you should check out the
[Developing packages and plugins][] page.

## Overview

Every Flutter project includes a `pubspec.yaml` file,
often referred to as _the pubspec_.
A basic pubspec is generated when you create
a new Flutter project. It's located at the top
of the project tree and contains metadata about
the project that the Dart and Flutter tooling
needs to know. The pubspec is written in
[YAML][], which is human readable, but be aware
that _white space (tabs v spaces) matters_.

The pubspec specifies dependencies
that the project requires, such as:

+ Particular packages and their versions
+ Fonts
+ Images
+ Developer packages (like testing or mocking packages)
+ Particular constraints on the version of the Flutter SDK

Fields common to both Dart and Flutter projects
are described in [the pubspec file][] on [dart.dev][].
This page lists _Flutter-specific_ fields and packages
that are only valid for a Flutter project.

[YAML]: https://yaml.org/
[the pubspec file]: {{site.dart-site}}/tools/pub/pubspec
[dart.dev]: {{site.dart-site}}

## Example

When you create a new project with the
`flutter create` command (or by using the
equivalent button in your IDE), it creates
a pubspec for a basic Flutter app.

The first time you build your project, it
also creates a `pubspec.lock` file that contains
specific versions of the included packages.
This ensures that you get the same version
the next time the project is built.

Here is an example of a Flutter project pubspec file.
The Flutter-only fields and packages are highlighted.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
name: <project name>
description: A new Flutter project.

## Fields

Flutter-specific and Dart-specific fields can be added to
the Flutter pubspec. To learn more about Flutter-specific
fields, see the following sections. To learn more about
Dart-specific fields, see [Dart's pubspec supported fields][]. 

:::note
The pubspec can have additional auto-generated Flutter
fields that are not listed here.
:::

[Dart's pubspec supported fields]: {{site.dart-site}}/tools/pub/pubspec#supported-fields

### assets field {: #assets }

A list of asset paths that your app uses. These assets are
bundled with your application. Common types of assets
include static data (for example, `JSON`),
configuration files, icons, and images (`JPEG`, `WebP`,
`GIF`, animated `WebP/GIF`, `PNG`, `BMP`, and `WBMP`).

Besides listing the images that are included in the
app package, an image asset can also refer to one or more
resolution-specific "variants". For more information,
see the [resolution aware][] section of the
[Assets and images][] page.
For information on adding assets from package
dependencies, see the
[asset images in package dependencies][]
section in the same page.

The `asset` field has this structure:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  assets:
    - [ path_to_file | path_to_directory ]
      [ flavor_path_field ]
    [...]
```

```yaml
# path_to_file structure
- path/to/directory/file
```

```yaml
# path_to_directory structure
- path/to/directory/
```
```yaml
# flavor_path_field strucure
- path: path/to/directory
  flavors:
  - flavor_name
```

Subfields of `assets`:

* `path_to_file`: A string that represents the path to
  a file.
* `path_to_directory`: A string that represents the path to
  a directory.
* `flavor_path_field`: A path field and its flavor
  subfields.
* `path`: The path to a directory.
* `flavors`: A list of flutter flavors to use with assets
  at a specific path. To learn more about
  flavors, see [Set up flavors for iOS and macOS] and
  [Set up flavors for Android].

You can pass in a path to a file:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/my_image_a.png
    - assets/images/my_image_b.png
```

You can pass in a path to a directory:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
```

You can pass in a path to a directory for specific
flavors:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  assets:
    - path: assets/flavor_a_and_b/images
      flavors:
      - flavor_a
      - flavor_b
    - path: assets/flavor_c/images
      flavors:
      - flavor_c
```

[Set up flavors for iOS and macOS]: /deployment/flavors-ios
[Set up flavors for Android]: /deployment/flavors
[Assets and images]: /ui/assets/assets-and-images
[asset images in package dependencies]: /ui/assets/assets-and-images#from-packages
[resolution aware]: /ui/assets/assets-and-images#resolution-aware

### config field {: #config }

A map of keys to flags (`true` or `false`) that influences how the `flutter` CLI
is executed.

> NOTE: This feature is only available as of
> [#167953]({{site.github}}flutter/flutter/pull/167953) on the `main`
> channel.

The available keys mirror those available in `flutter config --list`.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  config:
    enable-swift-package-manager: true
```

Flags are only read from the current _application_ package, and have no effect
in the context of a package or dependency.

### default-flavor field

Assign a default Flutter flavor for an app.
When used, you don't need to include the name of this
flavor in Flutter launch command.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  default-flavor: flavor_name # Android-only field
```

In the following example, an Android Flutter app has a
flavor called `staging` and `production`. The `production`
flavor is the default flavor. When that flavor is run,
you don't need to include it in the launch command.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  default-flavor: production
```

```console title="console"
// Use this command to run the default flavor (production).
flutter run

// Use this command to run non-default flavors (staging).
flutter run --flavor staging
```

To learn how to create Flutter flavors,
see [Set up Flutter flavors for Android][] and
[Set up Flutter flavors for iOS and macOS][].

[Set up Flutter flavors for iOS and macOS]: /deployment/flavors-ios

### deferred-components field

Defer initial the download size of an Android app. Most
often used with large applications, modularized applications,
and applications with on-demand features.

The `deferred-components` field has this structure:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  deferred-components:
    name: component_name
      libraries:
        - string_expression
        [...]
      assets:
        - string_expression
        [...]
    [...]
```

Deferred component subfields:

* `name`: The unique identifier for a specific deferred
  component.
* `libraries`: A list of Dart libraries that are part of
  the deferred component.
* `assets`: A list of asset paths that are associated with
  the deferred component.

Example:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  deferred-components:
    - name: box_component
      libraries:
        - package:testdeferredcomponents/box.dart
    - name: gallery_feature
      libraries:
        - package:testdeferredcomponents/gallery_feature.dart
      assets:
        - assets/gallery_images/gallery_feature.png
```

To learn more about how you can use deferred components with
a Flutter Android app, see
[Deferred components for Android].

### disable-swift-package-manager field

Disable the use of the Swift Package Manager (SPM) so that
it no longer manages dependencies in your iOS and macOS
Flutter projects.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  disable-swift-package-manager: true
```

> NOTE: As of [#168433]({{site.github}}/flutter/flutter/pull/168433) on the
> `main` channel, this propery has moved to the [`config`](#config) section:
>
> ```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
> flutter:
>   config:
>     enable-swift-package-manager: false
> ```

### flutter field

A field that contains Flutter-specific settings for your
app.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  [flutter_field]
  [...]
```

### fonts field {: #fonts }

Configure and include custom fonts in your Flutter
application.

For examples of using fonts
see the [Use a custom font][] and
[Export fonts from a package][] recipes in the
[Flutter cookbook][].

The `fonts` field has this structure:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  fonts:
    -  { font_family_field | font_asset_field }
    [...]
```

```yaml
# font_family_field structure
- family: font_name
      fonts:
        - font_asset_field
        [...]
```

```yaml
# font_asset_field structure
- asset: path/to/directory/font_name
  weight: int_expression # Optional
  style: string_expression # Optional
```

Subfields of `fonts`:

+ `family`: Optional. The font family name. Can have
  multiple font assets.
+ `asset`: The font to use.
+ `weight`: Optional. The weight of the font. This can be
  `100`, `200`, `300`, `400`, `500`, `600`, `700`, `800` or
  `900`.
+ `style`: Optional. The style of the font. This can be
  `italic`.

Use a font that is not part of a font family:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  fonts:
    - asset: fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
      weight: 900 # Optional
      style: italic # Optional  
```

Use a font family:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  fonts:
  - family: Roboto # Optional
        fonts:
          - asset: fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
          - asset: fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf
            weight: 700 # Optional
            style: italic # Optional
```

Alternatively, if you have a font that requires no family,
weight or style requirements, you can declare it as a simple
asset:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  assets:
    - fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
```

### generate field

Handles localization tasks. This field can appear as a
subfield of `flutter` and `material`.

Enable general localization:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  generate: true
```

### plugin field

Configure settings specifically for Flutter plugins.

The `plugin` field has this structure:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  plugin:
    platforms:
      android: # Optional
        package: com.example.my_plugin
        pluginClass: MyPlugin
        dartPluginClass: MyPluginClassName

To learn more about plugins, see
[Developing packages & plugins][].

[Developing packages & plugins]: /packages-and-plugins/developing-packages

### shaders field

GLSL Shaders with the `FRAG` extension, must be declared in
the shaders section of your project's `pubspec.yaml` file.
The Flutter command-line tool compiles the shader to its
appropriate backend format, and generates its necessary
runtime metadata. The compiled shader is then included in
the application just like an asset.

The `shaders` field has this structure:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  shaders:
    -  { path_to_file | path_to_directory }
    [...]
```

```yaml
# path_to_file structure
- assets/shaders/file
```

```yaml
# path_to_directory structure
- assets/shaders/
```

Add specific shaders:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  shaders:
    - assets/shaders/shader_a.frag
    - assets/shaders/shader_b.frag
```

Add a directory of shaders:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  shaders:
    - assets/shaders/
```

Alternatively, you can add your shader directory to the
`assets` field:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/shaders/my_shader.frag
```

### uses-material-design field

Use Material Design components in your Flutter app.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
```

## Packages

The following Flutter-specific packages can be added to the
pubspec. If you add a package, run `flutter pub get` in your
terminal to install the package.

### flutter package

A package that represents the Flutter SDK itself and
can be added to the `dependencies` field. Use this if
your project relies on the Flutter SDK, not a regular
package from pub.dev.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
```

### flutter_localizations package

A package that represents the Flutter SDK itself and
can be added to the `dependencies` field. Use this to
enable the localization of `ARB` files. Often used with
the `intl` package.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter_localizations:
    sdk: flutter
  intl: ^0.18.0
```

### flutter_test package

A package that represents the Flutter SDK itself and
can be added to the `dependencies` field. Use this if you
have unit, widget, or integration tests for your Flutter
app.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
```

### flutter_lints package

A package that that provides a set of recommended lints for
Flutter projects. This package can be added to the
`dev_dependency` field in the pubspec.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_lints: ^2.0.0
```

### cupertino_icons

A package that provides a set of Apple's Cupertino icons
for use in Flutter applications. This package can be added
to the `dependency` field in the pubspec.

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.0
```
