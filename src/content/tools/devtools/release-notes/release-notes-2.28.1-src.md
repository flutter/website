# DevTools 2.28.1 release notes

The 2.28.1 release of the Dart and Flutter DevTools
includes the following changes among other general improvements.
To learn more about DevTools, check out the
[DevTools overview](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools).

## General updates

* Added support for DevTools extensions.
  This means if you are debugging an app that depends on `package:foo`,
  and `package:foo` provides a DevTools extension,
  you will see a "Foo" tab display in DevTools
  that you can use to debug your app.
  To provide a DevTools extension for your pub package,
  check out the getting started guide for
  [package:devtools_extensions](https://pub.dev/packages/devtools_extensions)!
