## Performance updates

* Added a new feature to help you debug raster jank in your Flutter app.
  This feature allows you to take a snapshot of the
  current screen shown in your app, and then
  break down rendering time for that scene by layer.
  This can help you identify parts of a scene that are expensive to rasterize -
