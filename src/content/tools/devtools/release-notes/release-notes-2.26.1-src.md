## General updates

- Added a new "Home" screen in DevTools that either shows the "Connect" dialog
  or a summary of your connected app, depending on
  the connection status in DevTools.
  Keep an eye on this screen for cool new features in the future.
  This change also enables support for static tooling
  (tools that don't require a connected app) in DevTools -
