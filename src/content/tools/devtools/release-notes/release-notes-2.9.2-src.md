## General updates

* Take our 2022 DevTools survey! Provide your feedback and help us improve
  your development experience. This survey prompt will show up directly in
  DevTools sometime in mid-February.

  *Note*: If you are having issues launching the survey, please make
  sure you have upgraded to the latest Flutter stable branch 2.10.
  There was a bug in DevTools (fixed in
  [#3574](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/3574)) that
  prevented the survey from being able to be opened, and unless you
  are on Flutter 2.10, this bug will still be present._
