* Added support for filtering with regular expressions in the
  Logging, Network, and CPU profiler pages - [#7027](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/7027)
* Add a DevTools server interaction for getting the DTD uri. - [#7054](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/7054)

## Memory updates

* Supported allocation tracing for Flutter profile builds and
  Dart AOT compiled applications. - [#7058](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/7058)
* Supported import of memory snapshots. - [#6974](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/6974)

## Debugger updates

  highlight the `$` in identifier interpolation as part of the interpolation,
  and properly highlight comments within type arguments. - [#6837](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/6837)

  that is created in a user's project. - [#7052](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/7052)
* Updated the Simulated DevTools Environment Panel to be collapsible
  (thanks to @victoreronmosele!) - [#7062](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/7062)
* Integrated DevTools extensions with the new Dart Tooling Daemon.

  other DTD clients, such as an IDE, as well as access a minimal file system API
  for interacting with the development project. - [#7108](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/7108)

## VS Code sidebar updates

* Fixed an issue that prevented the VS code sidebar from
  loading in recent `beta` and `main` builds. - [#6984](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/6984)
* Showed DevTools extensions as an option from the
  debug sessions DevTools dropdown, when available. [#6709](https://github.com/flutter/devtools/pull/6709)
