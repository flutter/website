As of release 3.27, the deep link validator tool

The deep link view validates any deep links
that are defined in your app.

To use this feature, open DevTools,
click into the **Deep Links** tab,
and import a Flutter project that contains deep links.

This tool helps you identify and troubleshoot any errors
in your mobile deep link setup,
from website configuration to manifest files.
DevTools provides instructions on how to fix any issues,
making the implementation process easier.
