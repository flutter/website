## What is DevTools?

DevTools is a suite of performance and debugging tools
for Dart and Flutter.
_Flutter DevTools_ and _Dart DevTools_ refer to the
same set of tools.

For a video introduction to DevTools, check out
the following deep dive and use-case walkthrough:

## What can I do with DevTools?

Here are some of the things you can do with DevTools:

* Inspect the UI layout and state of a Flutter app.
* Diagnose UI jank performance issues in a Flutter app.
* CPU profiling for a Flutter or Dart app.
* Network profiling for a Flutter app.
* Source-level debugging of a Flutter or Dart app.
* Debug memory issues in a Flutter or Dart
  command-line app.
* View general log and diagnostics information
  about a running Flutter or Dart
  command-line app.
* Analyze code and app size.
* Validate deep links in your Android or iOS app.

We expect you to use DevTools in conjunction with
your existing IDE or command-line based development workflow.

## How to launch DevTools {:#start}

You can launch DevTools with the following tools:

* [VS Code][]
* [Android Studio/IntelliJ][]
* [command line][]

## Troubleshooting some standard issues

**Question**: My app looks janky or stutters.
  How do I fix it?

**Answer**: Performance issues can cause [UI frames][]
  to be janky and/or slow down some operations.

  1. To detect which code impacts concrete late frames,
     start at [Performance > Timeline][].
  2. To learn which code takes the most CPU time in
     the background, use the [CPU profiler][].

For more information, check out the
[Performance][] page.

**Question**: I see a lot of garbage collection (GC) events occurring.
  Is this a problem?

**Answer**: Frequent GC events might display on
  the DevTools > Memory > Memory chart. In most cases,
  it's not a problem.

If your app has frequent background activity with some idle time,
Flutter might use that opportunity to collect the created objects
without performance impact.

## Providing feedback

Please give DevTools a try, provide feedback, and file issues
in the [DevTools issue tracker][]. Thanks!
