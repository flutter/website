title: Use the Performance view
description: Learn how to use the DevTools performance view.
---

:::note
The DevTools performance view works for Flutter mobile and desktop apps.
For web apps, Flutter adds timeline events to the
performance panel of Chrome DevTools instead.
To learn about profiling web apps,
check out [Debugging web performance][].
:::

[Debugging web performance]: /perf/web-performance

The performance page can help you diagnose performance
problems and UI jank in your application.
This page offers timing and performance information
for activity in your application.
It consists of several tools to help you identify
the cause of poor performance in your app:

* Flutter frames chart (Flutter apps only)
* Frame analysis tab (Flutter apps only)
* Timeline events trace viewer (all native Dart applications)
* Advanced debugging tools (Flutter apps only)

:::secondary
**Use a [profile build][] of your application to analyze performance.**
Frame rendering times aren't indicative of release performance
when running in debug mode. Run your app in profile mode,
which still preserves useful debugging information.
:::

[profile build]: /testing/build-modes#profile

The performance view also supports importing and exporting of
data snapshots. For more information,
check out the [Import and export][] section.

## What is a frame in Flutter?

Flutter is designed to render its UI at 60 frames per second
(fps), or 120 fps on devices capable of 120Hz updates.
Each render is called a _frame_.
This means that, approximately every 16ms, the UI updates
to reflect animations or other changes to the UI. A frame
that takes longer than 16ms to render causes jank
(jerky motion) on the display device.

## Flutter frames chart

This chart contains Flutter frame information for your application.
Each bar set in the chart represents a single Flutter frame.
The bars are color-coded to highlight the different portions
of work that occur when rendering a Flutter frame: work from
the UI thread and work from the raster thread.

This chart contains Flutter frame timing information for your
application. Each pair of bars in the chart represents a single
Flutter frame. Selecting a frame from this chart updates the data
that is displayed below in the [Frame analysis](#frame-analysis-tab) tab
or the [Timeline events](#timeline-events-tab) tab.

[DevTools 2.23.1]: /tools/devtools/release-notes/release-notes-2.23.1

The flutter frames chart updates when new frames
are drawn in your app. To pause updates to this chart,
click the pause button to the right of the chart.
This chart can be collapsed to provide more viewing space
for data below by clicking the **Flutter frames** button above the chart.

The pair of bars representing each Flutter frame are color-coded
to highlight the different portions of work that occur when rendering
a Flutter frame: work from the UI thread and work from the raster thread.

### UI

The UI thread executes Dart code in the Dart VM. This includes
code from your application as well as the Flutter framework.
When your app creates and displays a scene, the UI thread creates
a layer tree, a lightweight object containing device-agnostic
painting commands, and sends the layer tree to the raster thread
to be rendered on the device. Do **not** block this thread.

### Raster

The raster thread executes graphics code from the Flutter Engine.
This thread takes the layer tree and displays it by talking to
the GPU (graphic processing unit). You can't directly access
the raster thread or its data, but if this thread is slow,
it's a result of something you've done in the Dart code.
Skia, the graphics library, runs on this thread.
[Impeller][] also uses this thread.

[Impeller]: /perf/impeller

Sometimes a scene results in a layer tree that is easy to construct,
but expensive to render on the raster thread. In this case, you
need to figure out what your code is doing that is causing
rendering code to be slow. Specific kinds of workloads are more
difficult for the GPU. They might involve unnecessary calls to
`saveLayer()`, intersecting opacities with multiple objects,
and clips or shadows in specific situations.

For more information on profiling, check out
[Identifying problems in the GPU graph][GPU graph].

### Jank (slow frame)

The frame rendering chart shows jank with a red overlay.
A frame is considered to be janky if it takes more than
~16 ms to complete (for 60 FPS devices). To achieve a frame rendering rate of
60 FPS (frames per second), each frame must render in
~16 ms or less. When this target is missed, you may
experience UI jank or dropped frames.

For more information on how to analyze your app's performance,
check out [Flutter performance profiling][].

### Shader compilation

Shader compilation occurs when a shader is first used in your Flutter
app. Frames that perform shader compilation are marked in dark
red:

![Screenshot of shader compilation for a frame](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/shader-compilation-frames-chart.png)

For more information on how to reduce shader compilation jank,
check out [Reduce shader compilation jank on mobile][].

## Frame analysis tab

Selecting a janky frame (slow, colored in red)
from the Flutter frames chart above shows debugging hints
in the Frame analysis tab. These hints help you diagnose
jank in your app, and notify you of any expensive operations
that we have detected that might have contributed to the slow frame time.

## Timeline events tab

The timeline events chart shows all event tracing from your application.
The Flutter framework emits timeline events as it works to build frames,
draw scenes, and track other activity such as HTTP request timings
and garbage collection. These events show up here in the Timeline.
You can also send your own Timeline events using the dart:developer
[`Timeline`][] and [`TimelineTask`][] APIs.

[`Timeline`]: {{site.api}}/flutter/dart-developer/Timeline-class.html
[`TimelineTask`]: {{site.api}}/flutter/dart-developer/TimelineTask-class.html

![Screenshot of a timeline events tab](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/timeline-events-tab.png)
For help with navigating and using the trace viewer,
click the **?** button at the top right of the timeline
events tab bar. To refresh the timeline with new events from
your application, click the refresh button
(also in the upper right corner of the tab controls).

## Advanced debugging tools

### Enhance tracing

To view more detailed tracing in the timeline events chart,
use the options in the enhance tracing dropdown:

:::note
Frame times might be negatively affected when these options are enabled.

To see the new timeline events, reproduce the activity
in your app that you are interested in tracing,
and then select a frame to inspect the timeline.

### Track widget builds

To see the `build()` method events in the timeline,
enable the **Track Widget Builds** option.
The name of the widget is shown in the timeline event.

[Watch this video for an example of tracking widget builds][track-widgets]

### Track layouts

To see render object layout events in the timeline,
enable the **Track Layouts** option:

![Screenshot of track layouts](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/track-layouts.png)

[Watch this video for an example of tracking layouts][track-layouts]

### Track paints

To see render object paint events in the timeline,
enable the **Track Paints** option:

![Screenshot of track paints](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/track-paints.png)

[Watch this video for an example of tracking paints][track-paints]

## More debugging options

To diagnose performance problems related to rendering layers,
toggle off a rendering layer.
These options are enabled by default.

To see the effects on your app's performance,
reproduce the activity in your app.
Then select the new frames in the frames chart
to inspect the timeline events
with the layers disabled.
If raster time has significantly decreased,
excessive use of the effects you disabled might be contributing
to the jank you saw in your app.

**Render Clip layers**
: Disable this option to check whether excessive use of clipping
  is affecting performance.
  If performance improves with this option disabled,
  try to reduce the use of clipping effects in your app.
  
**Render Opacity layers**
:  Disable this option to check whether
   excessive use of opacity effects are affecting performance.
   If performance improves with this option disabled,
   try to reduce the use of opacity effects in your app.
  
**Render Physical Shape layers**
: Disable this option to check whether excessive
  use of physical modeling effects are affecting performance,
  such as shadows or elevation.
  If performance improves with this option disabled,
  try to reduce the use of physical modeling effects in your app.

## Import and export

DevTools supports importing and exporting performance snapshots.
Clicking the export button (upper-right corner above the
frame rendering chart) downloads a snapshot of the current data on the
performance page. To import a performance snapshot, you can drag and drop the
snapshot into DevTools from any page. **Note that DevTools only
supports importing files that were originally exported from DevTools.**
