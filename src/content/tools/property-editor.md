:::note
The Flutter Property Editor requires Flutter version 3.32 or higher.

## What is it?

The Flutter Property Editor is a powerful IDE-tool that lets you view and modify
widget properties directly from a visual interface.

It allows you to quickly discover and modify your widgets' existing and
available constructor arguments, eliminating the need to jump-to-definition or
manually edit the source code. Furthermore, its integration with the Flutter
inspector and hot reload enables you to view changes in real time, speeding up
UI development and iteration.

## How to access the Flutter Property Editor

1.  Open the Flutter Property Editor in your supported IDE ([VS Code][],
    [Android Studio/IntelliJ][]).

2.  Locate a [widget constructor invocation][] in your Flutter code.

3.  Move your cursor anywhere inside the widget constructor invocation. 

    For example, in the following `build` method, place your cursor anywhere
    between the `T` of `Text` and the ending parenthesis `)` after
    `TextOverflow.clip`:

    ```dart
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Text(
            'Hello World!',
            overflow: TextOverflow.clip,
        );
    }
    ```

4.  The Flutter Property Editor panel automatically updates to display the
    properties of the widget at your cursor location.

[Android Studio/IntelliJ]: /tools/android-studio#property-editor

### Runtime usage

#### Integration with the Flutter inspector

The Flutter Property Editor can be used in conjunction with the [Flutter inspector][] to inspect your widgets simultaneously in both tools.

1.  From your preferred IDE, run and debug your Flutter application.
    * [VS Code instructions][]
    * [Android Studio/IntelliJ instructions][]

2.  Open the [Flutter inspector][] in your IDE.

You can then use the Flutter inspector to load a widget in the Flutter Property Editor by either:

1. Selecting a widget in tree:
    * Click on a widget in the [inspector's widget tree][].

2. Selecting a widget in your app:
    * Enable ["Select Widget Mode"][] in the inspector.
    * Click on a widget in your running application.

Both actions will automatically:
- Jump to the widget's declaration in your source code.
- Load the selected widget in the Flutter Property Editor.

[VS Code instructions]: /tools/devtools/vscode/#run-and-debug
[Android Studio/IntelliJ instructions]: /tools/devtools/android-studio/#run-and-debug
[Flutter inspector]: /tools/devtools/inspector
[inspector's widget tree]: /tools/devtools/inspector#flutter-widget-tree
["Select Widget Mode"]: /tools/devtools/inspector#inspecting-a-widget

#### Integration with hot reload

The Flutter Property Editor can be used in conjunction with hot reload to view changes in real time.

1. From your preferred IDE, enable autosave and hot reloads on save.

    **VS Code**

    Add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

    ```json
    "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
    "dart.flutterHotReloadOnSave": "all",
    ```

    **Android Studio and IntelliJ**

    * Open `Settings > Tools > Actions on Save` and select `Configure autosave options`.
        - Check the option to `Save files if the IDE is idle for X seconds`.
        - **Recommended:** Set a small delay duration. For example, 2 seconds. 
    
    * Open `Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Flutter`. 
        - Check the option to `Perform hot reload on save`.

2.  Run and debug your Flutter application.
    * [VS Code instructions][]
    * [Android Studio/IntelliJ instructions][]

3.  Any changes you make from the Flutter Property Editor are automatically
    reflected in your running app.

## Feature set

The Flutter Property Editor comes equipped with several features designed to
speed up the development process.

### Viewing widget documentation

When a widget is selected in the Flutter Property Editor, its documentation is
displayed at the top. This allows you to quickly read the widget documentation,
without needing to jump-to-definition or search online. 

By default, the widget documentation is truncated. Click on "Show more" to
expand the widget documentation.

:::tip
To see the documentation for your app's custom widgets in the Flutter Property
Editor, make sure to follow the [Dart style guide][].

### Editing widget properties

The Flutter Property Editor contains input fields tailored to the type of each
constructor argument.

- **string, double, and int properties:**
    * These are represented by text input fields.
    * Simply type the new value into the field.
    * Press ••Tab•• or ••Enter•• to apply the edit directly to your source code.

- **boolean and enum properties:**
    * These are represented by dropdown menus.
    * Click the dropdown to see the available options (`true`/`false` for
      booleans, or the various enum values).
    * Select the desired value from the list to apply it to your code.

- **object properties (for example, `TextStyle`, `EdgeInsets`, `Color`):**
    * Currently not supported. The Flutter Property Editor does not yet allow
      direct editing of complex object properties. You will need to edit these
      directly in your source code.

### Understanding the property inputs

Each property input in the Flutter Property Editor is accompanied by information
to help you understand its usage.

- **Type and name:** The **type** (for example, `StackFit`) and the **name**
  (for example, `fit`) of the constructor parameter are displayed as a label
  for each input field.

    ![Type and name label for a property input](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/property-editor-name-type.png){:width="500px"}

- **Info tooltip (ⓘ):**
    * Hovering over the info icon next to a property input displays a tooltip.
    * The information in the tooltip includes:
        * The default value of the property, if one is defined in the widget's constructor.
        * Any documentation for that property.

    ![Info tooltip for a property input](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/property-editor-tooltip.png){:width="600px"}

* **"Set" and "default" labels:**
    * The **"set"** label appears next to an input if the property has been
      explicitly set in your source code. This means there is a corresponding
      argument provided in the widget constructor call.
    * The **"default"** label appears next to an input if the current property
      value matches the default parameter value as defined in the widget.

    :::tip
    If a property input has both a "set" and a "default" label, it means you
    have explicitly provided a value in your code, but this value is the same as
    the widget's default value for that property. In such cases, you can safely
    remove this argument from your code to make it more concise, as the widget
    will use the default value anyway.

### Filtering properties

For widgets with many properties, the filter bar can help to quickly locate
properties of interest.

* **Filter by text:**
    * Simply type into the filter bar. The list of properties will dynamically
      update to show only those that match your input.
    * You can filter by a property's name, its current value, or its type. For
      example:
        * Typing "main" would filter to `mainAxisAlignment`, `mainAxisSize`, or
          other properties with "main" in their name.
        * Typing "true" would filter to all boolean properties currently set to
          `true`.
        * Typing "double" would filter to all properties of type `double`.

    ![Filter input with filtering by text highlighted](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/property-editor-filter-text.png){:width="500px"}   

* **Filter by "set" properties:**
    * Use the filter menu button to open the filter options. Check "Only
      include properties that are set in the code."
    * This hides all properties that have not been explicitly set in your
      code, allowing you to focus only on the properties you have explictly set.

    ![Filter input with filter menu button highlighted](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/property-editor-filter-menu-button.png){:width="500px"}   

* **Filter with a regex:**
    * The regex toggle (an `*` icon button) allows you to toggle on regex mode
      for the filter input.
    * When enabled, your filter text will be interpreted as a regular
      expression.

    ![Filter input with regex toggle highlighted](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/property-editor-filter-regex-toggle.png){:width="500px"} 

* **Clear the current filter:**
    * The clear button (an `X` icon button) clears out any active filters,
      displaying all properties of the widget again.
