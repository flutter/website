## Installation and setup

Follow the [Set up an editor][] instructions to
install the Dart and Flutter extensions
(also called plugins).

### Updating the extension {:#updating}

Updates to the extensions are shipped on a regular basis.
By default, VS Code automatically updates extensions when
updates are available.

To install updates yourself:

1. Click **Extensions** in the Side Bar.
1. If the Flutter extension has an available update,
   click **Update** and then **Reload**.
1. Restart VS Code.

## Creating projects

There are a couple ways to create a new project.

### Creating a new project

To create a new Flutter project from the Flutter
starter app template:

1. Go to **View** <span aria-label="and then">></span>
   **Command Palette...**.

   You can also press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
   <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>.

1. Type `flutter`.
1. Select the **Flutter: New Project**.
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
1. Select **Application**.
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
1. Select a **Project location**.
1. Enter your desired **Project name**.

### Opening a project from existing source code

To open an existing Flutter project:

1. Go to **File** <span aria-label="and then">></span> **Open**.

   You can also press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>

1. Browse to the directory holding your existing
   Flutter source code files.
1. Click **Open**.

## Editing code and viewing issues

The Flutter extension performs code analysis.
The code analysis can:

- Highlight language syntax
- Complete code based on rich type analysis
- Navigate to type declarations

  - Go to **Go** <span aria-label="and then">></span> **Go to Definition**.
  - You can also press <kbd>F12</kbd>.

- Find type usages.

  - Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd>.

- View all current source code problems.

  - Go to **View** <span aria-label="and then">></span> **Problems**.
  - You can also press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
    <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>.
  - The Problems pane displays any analysis issues:<br>
    ![Problems pane](/assets/images/docs/tools/vs-code/problems.png){:.mw-100 .pt-1}

## Running and debugging

:::note
You can debug your app in a couple of ways.

- Using [DevTools][], a suite of debugging and profiling
  tools that run in a browser.
- Using VS Code's built-in debugging features,
  such as setting breakpoints.

The instructions below describe features available in VS Code.
For information on launching and using DevTools, see
[Running DevTools from VS Code][] in the [DevTools][] docs.
:::

Start debugging by clicking **Run > Start Debugging**
from the main IDE window, or press <kbd>F5</kbd>.

### Selecting a target device

When a Flutter project is open in VS Code,
you should see a set of Flutter specific entries in the status bar,
including a Flutter SDK version and a
device name (or the message **No Devices**):<br>
![VS Code status bar][]{:.mw-100 .pt-1}

:::note
- If you do not see a Flutter version number or device info,
  your project might not have been detected as a Flutter project.
  Ensure that the folder that contains your `pubspec.yaml` is
  inside a VS Code **Workspace Folder**.
- If the status bar reads **No Devices**, Flutter has not been
  able to discover any connected iOS or Android devices or simulators.
  You need to connect a device, or start a simulator or emulator,
  to proceed.
:::

The Flutter extension automatically selects the last device connected.
However, if you have multiple devices/simulators connected, click
**device** in the status bar to see a pick-list
at the top of the screen. Select the device you want to use for
running or debugging.

:::secondary
**Are you developing for macOS or iOS remotely using
Visual Studio Code Remote?** If so, you might need to manually
unlock the keychain. For more information, see this
[question on StackExchange][].

### Run app without breakpoints

Go to **Run** > **Start Without Debugging**.

You can also press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>.

### Run app with breakpoints

1. If desired, set breakpoints in your source code.
1. Click **Run** <span aria-label="and then">></span> **Start Debugging**.
   You can also press <kbd>F5</kbd>.
   The status bar turns orange to show you are in a debug session.<br>
   ![Debug console](/assets/images/docs/tools/vs-code/debug_console.png){:.mw-100 .pt-1}

   - The left **Debug Sidebar** shows stack frames and variables.
   - The bottom **Debug Console** pane shows detailed logging output.
   - Debugging is based on a default launch configuration.
     To customize, click the cog at the top of the
     **Debug Sidebar** to create a `launch.json` file.
     You can then modify the values.

### Run app in debug, profile, or release mode

Flutter offers many different build modes to run your app in. 
You can read more about them in [Flutter's build modes][].

1. Open the `launch.json` file in VS Code.

   If you don't have a `launch.json` file:

   {: type="a"}
   1. Go to **View** <span aria-label="and then">></span> **Run**.

      You can also press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
      <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>

      The **Run and Debug** panel displays.

   1. Click **create a launch.json file**.

1. In the `configurations` section,
   change the `flutterMode` property to
   the build mode you want to target.

   For example, if you want to run in debug mode,
   your `launch.json` might look like this:

    ```json
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Flutter",
        "request": "launch",
        "type": "dart",
        "flutterMode": "debug"
      }
    ]
    ```

1. Run the app through the **Run** panel.

## Fast edit and refresh development cycle

Flutter offers a best-in-class developer cycle enabling you
to see the effect of your changes almost instantly with the
_Stateful Hot Reload_ feature.
To learn more, check out [Hot reload][].

## Advanced debugging

You might find the following advanced debugging tips useful:

### Debugging visual layout issues

During a debug session,
several additional debugging commands are added to the
[Command Palette][] and to the [Flutter inspector][].
When space is limited, the icon is used as the visual
version of the label.

**Toggle Baseline Painting** ![Baseline painting icon](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/paint-baselines-icon.png){:width="20px"}
: Causes each RenderBox to paint a line at each of its baselines.

**Toggle Repaint Rainbow** ![Repaint rainbow icon](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/repaint-rainbow-icon.png){:width="20px"}
: Shows rotating colors on layers when repainting.

**Toggle Slow Animations** ![Slow animations icon](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/slow-animations-icon.png){:width="20px"}
: Slows down animations to enable visual inspection.

**Toggle Debug Mode Banner** ![Debug mode banner icon](/assets/images/docs/tools/devtools/debug-mode-banner-icon.png){:width="20px"}
: Hides the debug mode banner even when running a debug build.

### Debugging external libraries

By default, debugging an external library is disabled
in the Flutter extension. To enable:

1. Select **Settings > Extensions > Dart Configuration**.
2. Check the `Debug External Libraries` option.

## Editing tips for Flutter code

If you have additional tips we should share, [let us know][]!

### Assists & quick fixes

Assists are code changes related to a certain code identifier.
A number of these are available when the cursor is placed on a
Flutter widget identifier, as indicated by the yellow lightbulb icon.
To invoke the assist, click the lightbulb as shown in the following screenshot:

![Code assists](/assets/images/docs/tools/vs-code/assists.png){:width="467px"}

You can also press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd>

Quick fixes are similar,
only they are shown with a piece of code has an error and they
can assist in correcting it.

**Wrap with new widget assist**
: This can be used when you have a widget that you want to wrap
  in a surrounding widget, for example if you want to wrap a
  widget in a `Row` or `Column`.

**Wrap widget list with new widget assist**
: Similar to the assist above, but for wrapping an existing
  list of widgets rather than an individual widget.

**Convert child to children assist**
: Changes a child argument to a children argument,
  and wraps the argument value in a list.

**Convert StatelessWidget to StatefulWidget assist**
: Changes the implementation of a `StatelessWidget` to that of
  a `StatefulWidget`, by creating the `State` class and moving
  the code there.

### Snippets

Snippets can be used to speed up entering typical code structures.
They are invoked by typing their prefix,
and then selecting from the code completion window:
![Snippets](/assets/images/docs/tools/vs-code/snippets.png){:width="100%"}

The Flutter extension includes the following snippets:

- Prefix `stless`: Create a new subclass of -StatelessWidget`.
- Prefix `stful`: Create a new subclass of `StatefulWidget`
  and its associated State subclass.
- Prefix `stanim`: Create a new subclass of `StatefulWidget`,
  and its associated State subclass including a field initialized
  with an `AnimationController`.

The Dart extension includes the following snippets:

| Prefix | Description | Code Example |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Insert a main function, used as an entry point. | `void main(List<String> args) {  }` |
| `try` | Insert a try/catch block. | `try {  } catch (e) {  }` |
| `if` | Insert an if statement. | `if (condition) {  }` |
| `ife` | Insert an if statement with an else block. | `if (condition) {  } else {  }` |
| `switch` | Insert a switch statement. | `switch (variable) { case value1:  break; case value2:  break; default:  }` |
| `for` | Insert a for loop. | `for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {  }` |
| `fori` | Insert a for-in loop. | `for (var item in list) {  }` |
| `while` | Insert a while loop. | `while (condition) {  }` |
| `do` | Insert a do-while loop. | `do {  } while (condition);` |
| `fun` | Insert a function definition. | `void myFunction(String name) {  }` |
| `class` | Insert a class definition. | `class MyClass {  }` |
| `typedef` | Insert a typedef. | `typedef MyFunction = void Function(String);` |
| `test` | Insert a test block. | `test('My test description', () {  });` |
| `group` | Insert a test group block. | `group('My test group', () {  });` |

You can also define custom snippets by executing
**Configure User Snippets** from the [Command Palette][].

### Keyboard shortcuts

**Hot reload**
: To perform a hot reload during a debug session,
  click **Hot Reload** on the **Debug Toolbar**.
  
  You can also press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>
  (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>  on macOS).

  Keyboard mappings can be changed by executing the
  **Open Keyboard Shortcuts** command from the [Command Palette][].

### Hot reload vs. hot restart

Hot reload works by injecting updated source code files into the
running Dart VM (Virtual Machine). This includes not only
adding new classes, but also adding methods and fields to
existing classes, and changing existing functions.
A few types of code changes cannot be hot reloaded though:

- Global variable initializers
- Static field initializers
- The `main()` method of the app

For these changes, restart your app without
ending your debugging session. To perform a hot restart,
run the **Flutter: Hot Restart** command from the [Command Palette][].

You can also press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>
or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd> on macOS.
