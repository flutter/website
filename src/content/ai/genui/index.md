## What is GenUI?

The GenUI SDK for Flutter helps an app developer
replace textual ("wall of text") LLM information with an
interactive, graphical UI.
It uses a JSON-based format to compose a UI from your existing
widget catalog. As a user interacts with the UI,
state changes are fed back to the agent,
creating a high-bandwidth loop and turning
an agent interaction into a rich, intuitive experience.

The GenUI SDK for Flutter is designed to easily integrate
into your Flutter application.

## When would you use it?

Use GenUI SDK for Flutter to incorporate graphical UI
into your app or chatbot.  For example:

* Instead of describing a list of products in text,
  use it to render an interactive carousel of product widgets.
* When a user asks to book a flight, use it to generate a
  complete form with sliders, date pickers, and text fields.
