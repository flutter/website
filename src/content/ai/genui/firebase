### Configure Firebase AI logic

To use the built-in `FirebaseAiContentGenerator` to connect
to Gemini using the Firebase AI Logic, follow these instructions:

 1. [Create a new Firebase project][] using the Firebase Console.

 2. [Enable the Gemini API][] for that project.

 3. Follow the first three steps in [Firebase's Flutter setup guide][]
    to add Firebase to your app.

 4. In `pubspec.yaml`, add `genui` and `genui_firebase_ai`
    to the `dependencies` section.

    ```yml
    dependencies:
      # ...
      genui: ^latest_version             #Replace with the actual latest version
      genui_firebase_ai: ^latest_version # " "
    ```

 5. In your app's `main` method, ensure that the widget
    bindings are initialized and then initialize Firebase.

    ```dart
    void main() async {
      WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
      await Firebase.initializeApp(options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform);
      runApp(const MyApp());
    }
    ```

### Configure another agent provider

To use `genui` with another agent provider,
follow that provider's instructions to configure your app,
and then create your own subclass of `ContentGenerator` to connect
to that provider. Use `FirebaseAiContentGenerator` or
`A2uiContentGenerator` (from the `genui_a2ui` package)
as examples of how to do so.
