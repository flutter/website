  Learn how to add AI rules to tools that accelerate your
  development workflow.

This guide covers how you can leverage AI rules to
streamline your Flutter and Dart development.

## Overview

AI-powered editors use rules files to provide context and
instructions to an underlying LLM. These files help you:

*   Customize AI behavior to your team's needs.
*   Enforce project best practices for code style and
    design.
*   Provide critical project context to the AI.

## Environments that support rules

Many AI environments support rules files to guide
LLM behavior. Here are some common examples and their
corresponding rule file names:

| Environment | Rules File | Installation Instructions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Copilot powered IDEs | `copilot-instructions.md` | [Configure .github/copilot-instructions.md][] |
| Cursor | `cursor.md` | [Configure cursorrules.md][] |
| Firebase Studio | `airules.md` | [Configure airules.md][] |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | [Configure gemini.md][] |
| JetBrains IDEs | `guidelines.md` | [Configure guidelines.md][] |
| VS Code | `.instructions.md` | [Configure .instructions.md][] |
| Windsurf | `guidelines.md` | [Configure guidelines.md][] |

## Create rules for your editor

You can adapt our Flutter and Dart rules template for your
specific environment. To do so, follow these steps:

1.  Download the Flutter and Dart rules template:
    <a href="/assets/files/flutter-rules-template.md" download>flutter-rules-template.md</a>

1.  In an LLM like [Gemini][], attach the
    `flutter-rules-template.md` file that you downloaded in
    the last step.
    
1.  Provide a prompt to reformat the file for your desired
    editor.

    Example prompt:

    ```text
    Convert the attached flutter-rules-template.txt file
    into a guidelines.md file for JetBrains IDE. Make sure
    to use the styles required for a guidelines.md file.
    ```

1.  Review the LLM's output and make any necessary
    adjustments.

1.  Follow your environment's instructions to add the new
    rules file. This may involve adding to an existing file
    or creating a new one.

1.  Verify that your AI assistant is using the new rules to
    guide its responses.
