  An overview of the Flutter's team philosophy and processes for security.

The Flutter team takes the security of Flutter and the applications
created with it seriously. This page describes how to report any
vulnerabilities you might find, and lists best practices to minimize
the risk of introducing a vulnerability.

## Security philosophy

Flutter security strategy is based on five key pillars:

* **Identify**: Track and prioritize key security risks by
  identifying core assets, key threats, and vulnerabilities. 
* **Detect**: Detect and identify vulnerabilities using
  techniques and tools like vulnerability scanning,
  static application security testing, and fuzzing.
* **Protect**: Eliminate risks by mitigating known
  vulnerabilities and protect critical assets against source threats.
* **Respond**: Define processes to report, triage, and
  respond to vulnerabilities or attacks.
* **Recover**: Build capabilities to contain and recover
  from an incident with minimal impact.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

Before reporting a security vulnerability found
by a static analysis tool,
consider checking our list of [known false positives][].

To report a vulnerability, email `security@flutter.dev`
with a description of the issue,
the steps you took to create the issue,
affected versions, and if known, mitigations for the issue.

We should reply within three working days.

We use GitHub's security advisory feature to track
open security issues. You should expect a close collaboration
as we work to resolve the issue that you have reported. 

Please reach out to `security@flutter.dev` again if
you don't receive prompt attention and regular updates.
You might also reach out to the team using our public
[Discord chat channels][]; however, when reporting an issue,
e-mail `security@flutter.dev`.
To avoid revealing information about vulnerabilities
in public that could put users at risk,
**don't post to Discord or file a GitHub issue**.

For more details on how we handle security vulnerabilities,
see our [security policy][].

##  Flagging existing issues as security-related

If you believe that an existing issue is security-related,
we ask that you send an email to `security@flutter.dev`. 
The email should include the issue ID and a short description
of why it should be handled according to this security policy.

## Supported versions

We commit to publishing security updates for the version of
Flutter currently on the `stable` branch.

## Expectations

We treat security issues equivalent to a P0 priority level
and release a beta or hotfix for any major security issues
found in the most recent stable version of our SDK. 

Any vulnerability reported for flutter websites like
docs.flutter.dev doesn't require a release and will be
fixed in the website itself.

## Bug Bounty programs

Contributing teams can include Flutter within the scope
of their bug bounty programs. To have your program listed,
contact `security@flutter.dev`.

Google considers Flutter to be in scope for the
[Google Open Source Software Vulnerability Reward Program][google-oss-vrp].
For expediency, reporters should contact `security@flutter.dev`
before using Google's vulnerability reporting flow.

## Receiving security updates

The best way to receive security updates is to subscribe to the 
[flutter-announce][] mailing list or watch updates to the
[Discord channel][]. We also announce security updates in the
technical release blog post.

## Best practices

* **Keep current with the latest Flutter SDK releases.**
  We regularly update Flutter, and these updates might fix security
  defects discovered in previous versions.

* **Keep your application's dependencies up to date.**
  Make sure you [upgrade your package dependencies][]
  to keep the dependencies up to date.
  Avoid pinning to specific versions
  for your dependencies and, if you do, make sure you check
  periodically to see if your dependencies have had security updates,
  and update the pin accordingly.

* **Keep your copy of Flutter up to date.**
  Private, customized versions of Flutter tend
  to fall behind the current version and might not
  include important security fixes and enhancements.
  Instead, routinely update your copy of Flutter.
  If you're making changes to improve Flutter,
  be sure to update your fork and consider sharing your
  changes with the community.
