## Set up Android tooling {: #set-up-tooling}

With Android Studio, you can run Flutter apps on
a physical Android device or an Android Emulator.

If you haven't done so already,
install and set up the latest stable version of [Android Studio][].

 1. <h3>Install prerequisites libraries</h3>

    If you're developing on Linux, first install the
    [prerequisite collection of 32-bit libraries][64bit-libs]
    that Android Studio requires.
    {: .linux-only}

 1. <h3>Install Android Studio</h3>

    If you haven't done so already, [install and set up][as-install]
    the latest stable version of [Android Studio][].

    If you already have Android Studio installed,
    ensure that it's [up to date][as-update].

 1. <h3>Install Android SDK and tools</h3>

    1. Launch **Android Studio**.

    1. Go to the **Settings** page to view the **SDK Manager**.

      1. If you have a project open,
         go to **Tools** <span aria-label="and then">></span> **SDK Manager**.

      1. If the **Welcome to Android Studio** dialog is open,
         click the **More Options** icon that follows the **Open** button,
         then click **SDK Manager** from the dropdown menu.

    1. If the **SDK Platforms** tab is not open, switch to it.

    1. Verify that the first entry with an **API Level** of
       **{{ site.platform.androidApiLevel }}** has been selected.

       If the **Status** column displays
       **Update available** or **Not installed**:

       1. Select the checkbox for that entry or row.

       1. Click **Apply**.

       1. When the **Confirm Change** dialog displays, click **OK**.

          The **SDK Component Installer** dialog displays with a
          progress indicator.

       1. When the installation finishes, click **Finish**.

       {: type="a"}

    1. Switch to the **SDK Tools** tab.

    1. Verify that the following SDK Tools have been selected:

       - **Android SDK Build-Tools**
       - **Android SDK Command-line Tools**
       - **Android Emulator**
       - **Android SDK Platform-Tools**

    1. If the **Status** column for any of the preceding tools displays
       **Update available** or **Not installed**:

       1. Select the checkbox for the necessary tools.

       1. Click **Apply**.

       1. When the **Confirm Change** dialog displays, click **OK**.

          The **SDK Component Installer** dialog displays with a
          progress indicator.

       1. When the installation finishes, click **Finish**.

       {: type="a"}

   1. <h3>Agree to the Android licenses</h3>

      Before you can use Flutter and after you install all prerequisites,
      agree to the licenses of the Android SDK platform.

      1. Open your preferred terminal.

      1. Run the following command to review and sign the SDK licenses.

         ```console
         $ flutter doctor --android-licenses
         ```

      1. Read and accept any necessary licenses.

         If you haven't accepted each of the SDK licenses previously,
         you'll need to review and agree to them before developing for Android.

         Before agreeing to the terms of each license,
         read each with care.

         Once you've accepted all the necessary licenses successfully,
         you should see output similar to the following:

         ```console
         All SDK package licenses accepted.
         ```

## Set up an Android device {: #set-up-devices}

You can debug Flutter apps on physical Android devices or
by running them on an Android emulator.

{% tabs "android-emulator-or-not" %}
{% tab "Android emulator" %}

To set up your development environment to
run a Flutter app on an Android emulator, follow these steps:

 1. <h3>Set up your development device</h3>

    Enable [VM acceleration][] on your development computer.

 1. <h3>Set up a new emulator</h3>

    1. Start **Android Studio**.

    1. Go to the **Settings** dialog to view the **SDK Manager**.

       1. If you have a project open,
          go to **Tools** <span aria-label="and then">></span>
          **Device Manager**.

       1. If the **Welcome to Android Studio** dialog is open,
          click the **More Options** icon that follows the **Open** button,
          then select **Device Manager** from the dropdown menu.

    1. Click **Virtual**.

    1. Click **Create Device**.

       The **Virtual Device Configuration** dialog displays.

[Configure on-device developer options]: {{site.android-dev}}/studio/debug/dev-options
[Connect to your device using Wi-Fi]: {{site.android-dev}}/studio/run/device#wireless
[Install OEM USB drivers]: {{site.android-dev}}/studio/run/oem-usb

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Validate your setup {: #validate-setup}

 1. <h3>Check for toolchain issues</h3>

    To check for any issues with your Android development setup,
    run the `flutter doctor` command in your preferred terminal:

    ```console
    $ flutter doctor
    ```

    If you see any errors or tasks to complete under
    the **Android toolchain** or **Android Studio** sections,

    Complete any mentioned tasks and then
    run `flutter doctor` again to verify any changes.

 1. <h3>Check for Android devices</h3>

    To ensure you set up your emulator and/or physical Android device correctly,
    run `flutter emulators` and `flutter devices` in your preferred terminal:

    ```console
    $ flutter emulators && flutter devices
    ```

    Depending on if you set up an emulator or a device,
    at least one should output an entry with the platform marked as **android**.
