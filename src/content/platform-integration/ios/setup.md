Learn how to set up your development environment
to run, build, and deploy Flutter apps for iOS devices.

:::note
If you haven't set up Flutter already,
visit and follow the [Get started with Flutter][] guide first.

If you've already installed Flutter,
ensure that it's [up to date][].
:::

[Get started with Flutter]: /get-started/install
[up to date]: /install/upgrade

## Set up iOS tooling {: #set-up-tooling}

With Xcode, you can run Flutter apps on
an iOS physical device or on the iOS Simulator.

 1. <h3>Install Xcode</h3>

    If you haven't done so already,
    [install and set up the latest version of Xcode][xcode].

    If you've already installed Xcode,
    update it to the latest version using the
    same installation method you used originally.

 1. <h3>Set up Xcode command-line tools</h3>

    To configure the Xcode command-line tools to use
    the version of Xcode you installed,
    run the following command in your preferred terminal:

    ```console
    $ sudo sh -c 'xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer && xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch'
    ```

    If you downloaded Xcode elsewhere or need to use a different version,
    replace `/Applications/Xcode.app` with the path to there instead.

 1. <h3>Agree to the Xcode licenses</h3>

    After you've set up Xcode and configured its command-line tools,
    agree to the Xcode licenses.

    1. Open your preferred terminal.

    1. Run the following command to review and sign the Xcode licenses.

       ```console
       $ sudo xcodebuild -license
       ```

    1. Read and agree to all necessary licenses.

       Before agreeing to the terms of each license,
       read each with care.

 1. <h3>Download prerequisite tooling</h3>

    To download iOS platform support and
    the latest iOS Simulator runtimes,
    run the following command in your preferred terminal.

    ```console
    $ xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS
    ```

 1. <h3>Install Rosetta</h3>

    If you're developing on an [Apple Silicon][] (ARM) Mac,
    [install Rosetta 2][]:

    ```console
    $ sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
    ```

 1. <h3>Install CocoaPods</h3>

    To support [Flutter plugins][] that use native iOS or macOS code,
    install the latest version of [CocoaPods][].

    Install CocoaPods by following the
    [CocoaPods installation guide][].

    If you've already installed CocoaPods,
    update it by following the [CocoaPods update guide][].

## Set up an iOS device {: #set-up-devices}

We recommend starting with the iOS Simulator as
it's easier to get set up than a physical iOS device.
However, you should also test your app on an actual
physical device.

{% tabs "ios-simulator-or-physical-device" %}
{% tab "Simulator" %}

Start the iOS Simulator with the following command:

```console
$ open -a Simulator
```

If you need to install a simulator for a different OS version,
check out [Downloading and installing additional Xcode components][]
on the Apple Developer site.

[Downloading and installing additional Xcode components]: {{site.apple-dev}}/documentation/xcode/downloading-and-installing-additional-xcode-components

{% endtab %}
{% tab "Physical device" %}

Set up each iOS device on which you want to test.

 1. <h3>Configure your physical iOS device</h3>

    1. Attach your iOS device to the USB port on your Mac.

    1. On first connecting an iOS device to your Mac,
       your device displays the **Trust this computer?** dialog.

    1. Click **Trust**.

       ![Trust Mac](/assets/images/docs/setup/trust-computer.png)
 
 1. <h3>Configure your physical iOS device</h3>

    Apple requires enabling **[Developer Mode][]**
    on the device to protect against malicious software.

    1. Tap on **Settings** <span aria-label="and then">></span>
       **Privacy & Security** <span aria-label="and then">></span>
       **Developer Mode**.

    1. Tap to toggle **Developer Mode** to **On**.

    1. Restart the device.

    1. When the **Turn on Developer Mode?** dialog appears,
       tap **Turn On**.

 1. <h3>Create a developer code signing certificate</h3>

    To send your app to a physical iOS device,
    _even_ for testing, you must establish trust
    between your Mac and the device.
    In addition to trusting the device when that
    popup appears, you must upload a signed
    developer certificate to your device.

    To create a signed development certificate,
    you need an Apple ID.
    If you don't have one, [create one][apple-account-new].
    You must also enroll in the [Apple Developer program][]
    and create an [Apple Developer account][].
    If you're just _testing_ your app on an iOS device,
    a personal Apple Developer account is free and works.

    :::note Apple Developer program
    When you want to _deploy_ your app to the App Store,
    you'll need to upgrade your personal Apple Developer account to
    a professional account.
    :::

 1. <h3>Prepare the device</h3>

    1. Find the **VPN & Device Management** menu under **Settings**.

       Toggle your certificate to **Enable**.

       :::note
       If you can't find the **VPN & Device Management** menu,
       run your app on your iOS device once, then try again.
       :::

    1. Under the **Developer App** heading,
       you should find your certificate.

    1. Tap the certificate.

    1. Tap **Trust "&lt;certificate&gt;"**.

    1. When the dialog displays, tap **Trust**.

       If the **codesign wants to access key...** dialog appears:

       1. Enter your macOS password.

       1. Tap **Always Allow**.

## Start developing for iOS {: #start-developing}

**Congratulations.**
Now that you've set up iOS development for Flutter,
you can continue your Flutter learning journey while testing on iOS
or begin improving integration with iOS.
