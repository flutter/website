Due to security around
[local network permissions in iOS 14 or later][],
you must accept a permission dialog box to enable
Flutter debugging functionalities such as hot-reload
and DevTools.

This affects debug and profile builds only and won't
appear in release builds. You can also allow this
permission by enabling
**Settings > Privacy > Local Network > Your App**.
