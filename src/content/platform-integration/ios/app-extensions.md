title: Adding iOS app extensions
description: Learn how to add app extensions to your Flutter apps
---

iOS app extensions allow you to expand functionality
outside your app. Your app could appear as a home screen widget,
or you can make portions of your app available within other apps.

To learn more about app extensions, check out
[Apple's documentation][].

:::note
If you experience a build error when building an
iOS app that includes an app extension, be
aware that there is an open bug. The workaround
involves changing the order of the build process.
For more information, check out
[Issue #9690][] and [Issue #135056][].

iOS 18 added support for customizing a device's
Control Center, including creating multiple pages.
You can also create new toggles for the Control Center
using the [`ControlCenter`][] API, to feature your app.

## How do you add an app extension to your Flutter app?

To add an app extension to your Flutter app,
add the extension point *target* to your Xcode project.

1. Open the default Xcode workspace in your project by running
   `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in a terminal window from your
   Flutter project directory.
1. In Xcode, select **File -> New -> Target** from the menu bar.

      <div class="site-figure-container">
        <img src='/assets/images/docs/development/platform-integration/app-extensions/xcode-new-target.png' alt='Opening the File -> New menu, then selecting Target in Xcode.' height='300'>
      </div>
    </figure>
1. Select the app extension you intend to add.
   This selection generates extension-specific code 
   within a new folder in your project.
   To learn more about the generated code and the SDKs for each
   extension point, check out the resources in
   [Apple's documentation][].

[Adding a Home Screen Widget to your Flutter app][lab]
codelab.

## How do Flutter apps interact with App Extensions? 

Flutter apps interact with app extensions using the same
techniques as UIKit or SwiftUI apps.
The containing app and the app extension don't communicate directly.
The containing app might not be running while the device user
interacts with the extension.
The app and your extension can read and write to
shared resources or use higher-level APIs
to communicate with each other.

### Using higher-level APIs

Some extensions have APIs. For example, 
the [Core Spotlight][] framework indexes your app,
allowing users to search from Spotlight and Safari.
The [WidgetKit][] framework can trigger an update
of your home screen widget.

To simplify how your app communicates with extensions,
Flutter plugins wrap these APIs.
To find plugins that wrap extension APIs,
check out [Leveraging Apple's System APIs and Frameworks][leverage]
or search [pub.dev][].

### Sharing resources

To share resources between your Flutter app
and your app extension, put the `Runner` app target
and the extension target in the same [App Group][].

:::note
You must be signed in to your Apple Developer account.
:::

To add a target to an App Group:

1. Open the target settings in Xcode.
1. Navigate to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.
1. Select **+ Capability** then **App Groups**.
1. Choose which App Group you want to add the target from
   one of two options:

    {: type="a"}
    1. Select an App Group from the list.
    1. Click **+** to add a new App Group.

{% render docs/app-figure.md, image:"development/platform-integration/app-extensions/xcode-app-groups.png", alt:"Selecting an App Group within an Xcode Runner target configuration." %}

When two targets belong to the same App Group,
they can read from and write to the same source.
Choose one of the following sources for your data.

* **Key/value:** Use the [`shared_preference_app_group`][]
  plugin to read or write to `UserDefaults` within the same App Group.
* **File:** Use the App Group container path from the
  [`path_provider`][] plugin to [read and write files][].
* **Database:** Use the App Group container path from
  the [`path_provider`][] plugin to create a database with the
  [`sqflite`][] plugin.

### Background updates

Background tasks provide a means to update your extension
through code regardless of the status of your app.

To schedule background work from your Flutter app,
use the [`workmanager`][] plugin.

### Deep linking

You might want to direct users from an
app extension to a specific page in your Flutter app.
To open a specific route in your app,
you can use [Deep Linking][].

## Creating app extension UIs with Flutter

Some app extensions display a user interface.

For example, share extensions allow users to conveniently
share content with other apps,
such as sharing a picture to create
a new post on a social media app.

<figure>
  <div class="site-figure-container">
    <img src='/assets/images/docs/development/platform-integration/app-extensions/share-extension.png' alt='An example of an entry added to the share menu by a Flutter app' height='300'>
  </div>
</figure>

As of the 3.16 release, you can build
Flutter UI for an app extension,
though you must use an extension-safe
`Flutter.xcframework` and embed the
`FlutterViewController` as described in
the following section.

:::note
Due to the memory limitations of app extensions,
use Flutter to build an app extension UI for extension
types that have memory limits larger than 100MB.
For example, Share extensions have a 120MB memory limit.

In addition, Flutter uses extra memory in debug mode.
Therefore, Flutter doesn't fully support running
app extensions in debug mode on physical devices
when used to build extension UI; it might run out of memory.
As an alternative,
use an iOS simulator to test your extension in debug mode.
:::

1. Locate the extension-safe `Flutter.xcframework` file,
   at `<path_to_flutter_sdk>/bin/cache/artifacts/engine/ios/extension_safe/Flutter.xcframework`.
   
    * To build for release or profile modes,
      find the framework file under the
      `ios-release` or `ios-profile` folder, respectively.

1. Drag and drop the `Flutter.xcframework` file into your
   share extension's frameworks and libraries list.
   Make sure the embed column says "Embed & Sign".

   <figure>
     <div class="site-figure-container">
       <img src='/assets/images/docs/development/platform-integration/app-extensions/embed-framework.png' alt='The Flutter.xcframework file being marked as Embed & Sign in Xcode.' height='300'>
     </div>
   </figure>

1. Open the Flutter app project settings in Xcode
   to share build configurations. 

   {: type="a"}
   1. Navigate to the **Info** tab.
   1. Expand the **Configurations** group. 
   1. Expand the **Debug**, **Profile**, and **Release** entries.
   1. For each of these configurations, make sure the value in the
      **Based on configuration file** drop-down menu for your
      extension matches the one selected for the normal app target.

    <figure>
      <div class="site-figure-container">
        <img src='/assets/images/docs/development/platform-integration/app-extensions/xcode-configurations.png' alt='An example Xcode Runner configuration with each property set to: Based on configuration file.' height='300'>
      </div>
    </figure>

1. (Optional) Replace any storyboard files with an extension class, if needed.

    {: type="a"}
    1. In the `Info.plist` file,
       delete the **NSExtensionMainStoryboard** property.
    1. Add the **NSExtensionPrincipalClass** property.
    1. Set the value for this property to the entry point of the extension.
       For example, for share extensions, it's usually
       `<YourShareExtensionTargetName>.ShareViewController`.
       If you use Objective-C to implement the extension,
       you should omit the `<YourShareExtensionTargetName>.`
       portion.<br>

    <figure>
      <div class="site-figure-container">
        <img src='/assets/images/docs/development/platform-integration/app-extensions/share-extension-info.png' alt='Setting the NSExtensionPrincipalClass property in the Info.plist file within Xcode.' height='300'>
      </div>
    </figure>

1. Embed the `FlutterViewController` as described in
   [Adding a Flutter Screen][]. For example, you can display a
   specific route in your Flutter app within a share extension.

    ```swift
    import UIKit
    import Flutter

    class ShareViewController: UIViewController {
        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()
            showFlutter()
        }

        func showFlutter() {
            let flutterViewController = FlutterViewController(project: nil, nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
            addChild(flutterViewController)
            view.addSubview(flutterViewController.view)
            flutterViewController.view.frame = view.bounds
        }
    }
    ```

## Test extensions

Testing extensions on simulators and physical devices
have slightly different procedures.

{% comment %}
The different procedures are necessary due to bugs(which bugs?) in Xcode.
Revisit these docs after future Xcode releases to see if they are fixed.
{% endcomment -%}

### Test on a simulator

1. Build and run the main application target.
1. After the app is launched on the simulator,
   press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>
   to minimize the app, which switches to the home screen.
1. Launch an app that supports the share extension,
   such as the Photos app.
1. Select a photo, tap the share button, then tap
   on the share extension icon of your app.

### Test on a physical device

You can use the following procedure or the
[Testing on simulators](#test-on-a-simulator) instructions
to test on physical devices.

1. Launch the share extension target.
1. In the popup window that says "Choose an app to run",
   select an app that can be used to test share extension,
   such as the Photos app.
1. Select a photo, tap the share button,
   then tap on the share extension icon of your app.
