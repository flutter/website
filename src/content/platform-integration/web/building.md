This page provides an overview of how to configure, run, and build a web
application using Flutter.

## Requirements

Before you can build a web application with Flutter,
make sure that you have the [Flutter SDK][] and a web browser installed.
See the [Set up web development for Flutter][Setup-web] instructions
for details.

## Set up a Flutter project

To set up your project, you can create a
new Flutter project or add web support
to an existing project.

### Create a new project

To create a new app that includes web support, run the following command:

```console
$ flutter create my_app
```

### Add web support to an existing project

If you already have a project,
run the `flutter create` command in your project directory:

```console
$ flutter create . --platforms web
```

This creates a `web/` directory containing the web assets used to bootstrap
and run your Flutter app.

## Run your app

See the following sections to run your app.

### Run your app from the command line

Select [Chrome][] as your app's target device to run and debug
a Flutter web app:

```console
$ flutter run -d chrome
```

You can also choose Chrome as a target device in your IDE.

If you prefer, you can use the `edge` device type on Windows,
or use `web-server` to
navigate to a local URL in the browser of your choice.

<a id="hot-reload-web" aria-hidden="true" ></a>

:::note Hot reload on the web
As of the Flutter 3.35 release,
hot reload is enabled by default on the web.
[Hot restart][] is still available as well.

If you discover any issues we ask that you file a bug
using our [Web Hot Reload issue template][].
Note this is in the Dart SDK repository where it's easier
for us to track issues. Known issues can be seen in the
associated [GitHub project][].
:::

### Run your app using WebAssembly

You can pass the `--wasm` flag to run your app using WebAssembly:

```console
$ flutter run -d chrome --wasm
```

Flutter web offers multiple build modes and renderers.
For more information, see [Web renderers][].

### Disable hot reload in VS Code

To temporarily disable hot reload support from VS Code,
update your [`launch.json` file][] file with
the flag `--no-web-experimental-hot-reload`.

```plaintext
"configurations": [
    ...
    {
      "name": "Flutter for web (hot reload disabled)",
      "type": "dart",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "lib/main.dart",
      "args": [
        "-d",
        "chrome",
        "--no-web-experimental-hot-reload",
      ]
    }
  ]
```

### Disable hot reload from the command line

If you use `flutter run` from the command line,
you can temporarily disable hot reload on the web with the
following command:

```console
flutter run -d chrome --no-web-experimental-hot-reload
```

### Use hot reload in DartPad

Hot reload is also enabled in DartPad with a new "Reload" button.
The feature is only available if Flutter is detected
in the running application. You can begin a hot reloadable
session by selecting a sample app provided by DartPad.

## Build your app

See the following sections to build your app.

### Build your app from the command line

Run the following command to generate a release build:

```console
$ flutter build web
```

### Build your app using WebAssembly
You can also pass the `--wasm` flag to build your app using WebAssembly:

```console
$ flutter build web --wasm
```

This populates a `build/web` directory
with built files, including an `assets` directory,
which need to be served together.

To learn more about how to deploy these assets to the web, see
[Build and release a web app][].
For answers to other common questions, see the [Web FAQ][].

## Debugging

Use [Flutter DevTools][] for the following tasks:

* [Debugging][]
* [Logging][]
* [Running Flutter inspector][]

Use [Chrome DevTools][] for the following tasks:

* [Generating event timeline][]
* [Analyzing performance][]&mdash;make sure to use a
  profile build

## Testing

Use [widget tests][Widget tests] or integration tests. To learn more about
running integration tests in a browser, see the [Integration testing][] page.
