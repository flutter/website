# Windows lifecycle

## Who is affected

Windows applications built against Flutter versions after 3.13 that open non-Flutter windows.


## Overview

When adding a non-Flutter window to a Flutter Windows app, it will not be part
of the logic for application lifecycle state updates by default. For example,
this means that when the external window is shown or hidden, the app lifecycle
state will not appropriately update to inactive or hidden. As a result, the app
might receive incorrect lifecycle state changes through
[WidgetsBindingObserver.didChangeAppLifecycle][].

# What do I need to do?

To add the external window to this application logic,
the window's `WndProc` procedure
must invoke `FlutterEngine::ProcessExternalWindowMessage`.

To achieve this, add the following code to a window message handler function:

```cpp diff
  LRESULT Window::Messagehandler(HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wparam, LPARAM lparam) {
+     std::optional<LRESULT> result = flutter_controller_->engine()->ProcessExternalWindowMessage(hwnd, msg, wparam, lparam);
+     if (result.has_value()) {
+         return *result;
+     }
      // Original contents of WndProc...
  }
```
