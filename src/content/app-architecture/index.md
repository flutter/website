Architecture is an important part of building a
maintainable, resilient, and scalable Flutter app.
In this guide, you'll learn app architecture principles and
best practices for building Flutter apps.
<br />

'Architecture' is a word that's hard to define.
It's a broad term and can refer to any number
of topics depending on the context. In this guide,
'architecture' refers to how to structure, organize, and design
your Flutter app in order to scale as your project requirements and team grow.

## Benefits of intentional architecture

Good app architecture provides a number of benefits to engineering teams and
their end users.

* Maintainability - App architecture makes it easier to modify, update, and fix
  issues over time.
* Scalability - A well thought out application allows more people to contribute
  to the same codebase concurrently, with minimal code conflicts.
* Testability - Applications with intentional architecture generally have
  simpler classes with well-defined inputs and outputs, which makes them easier
  to mock and test.
* Lower cognitive load - Developers who are new to the project will be more
  productive in a shorter amount of time, and code reviews are generally less
  time-consuming when code is easier to understand.
* A better user experience - Features can ship faster and with less bugs.

## How to use this guide

This is a guide for building scalable Flutter applications and was written for
teams that have multiple developers contributing to the same code base,
who are building a feature-rich application.
If you are writing a Flutter app that has a *growing team and codebase*,
this guidance is for you.

Along with general architectural advice, this guide gives concrete examples of
best practices and includes specific recommendations.
Some libraries can be swapped out, and very large teams with unique complexity
might find that some parts don't apply.  In either case, the ideas remain
sound. This is the recommended way to build a Flutter app.

In the first part of this guide, you'll learn about common architectural
principles from a high level. In the second part,
the guide walks through specific and
concrete recommendations of architecting Flutter apps.
Finally, at the end of the guide, you'll find a list of design patterns and
sample code that shows the recommendations in action.
