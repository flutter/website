## Testing the UI layer

One way to determine whether your architecture is sound is
considering how easy (or difficult) the application is to test.
Because view models and views have well-defined inputs,
their dependencies can easily be mocked or faked,
and unit tests are easily written.

### ViewModel unit tests

To test the UI logic of the view model, you should write unit tests that
don't rely on Flutter libraries or testing frameworks.

Repositories are a view model's only dependencies
(unless you're implementing [use-cases][]),
and writing `mocks` or `fakes` of the repository is
the only setup you need to do.
In this example test, a fake called `FakeBookingRepository` is used.

```dart title=home_screen_test.dart
void main() {
  group('HomeViewModel tests', () {
    test('Load bookings', () {
      // HomeViewModel._load is called in the constructor of HomeViewModel.
      final viewModel = HomeViewModel(
        bookingRepository: FakeBookingRepository()
          ..createBooking(kBooking),
        userRepository: FakeUserRepository(),
      );

      expect(viewModel.bookings.isNotEmpty, true);
    });
  });
}
```

The [`FakeBookingRepository`][] class implements [`BookingRepository`][].
In the [data layer section][] of this case-study,
the `BookingRepository` class is explained thoroughly.

```dart title=fake_booking_repository.dart
class FakeBookingRepository implements BookingRepository {
  List<Booking> bookings = List.empty(growable: true);

  @override
  Future<Result<void>> createBooking(Booking booking) async {
    bookings.add(booking);
    return Result.ok(null);
  }
  // ...
}
```

:::note
If you're using this architecture with [use-cases][], these would
similarly need to be faked.
:::

### View widget tests

Once you've written tests for your view model,
you've already created the fakes you need to write widget tests as well.
The following example shows how the `HomeScreen` widget tests
are set up using the `HomeViewModel` and needed repositories:

```dart title=home_screen_test.dart
void main() {
  group('HomeScreen tests', () {
    late HomeViewModel viewModel;
    late MockGoRouter goRouter;
    late FakeBookingRepository bookingRepository;

    setUp(() {
      bookingRepository = FakeBookingRepository()
        ..createBooking(kBooking);
      viewModel = HomeViewModel(
        bookingRepository: bookingRepository,
        userRepository: FakeUserRepository(),
      );
      goRouter = MockGoRouter();
      when(() => goRouter.push(any())).thenAnswer((_) => Future.value(null));
    });

    // ...
  });
}
```

This setup creates the two fake repositories needed,
and passes them into a `HomeViewModel` object.
This class doesn't need to be faked.

:::note
The code also defines a `MockGoRouter`.
The router is mocked using [`package:mocktail`][],
and is outside the scope of this case-study. 
You can find general testing guidance in [Flutter's testing documentation][].
:::

After the view model and its dependencies are defined,
the Widget tree that will be tested needs to be created.
In the tests for `HomeScreen`, a `loadWidget` method is defined.

```dart title=home_screen_test.dart highlightLines=11-23
void main() {
  group('HomeScreen tests', () {
    late HomeViewModel viewModel;
    late MockGoRouter goRouter;
    late FakeBookingRepository bookingRepository;

    setUp(
      // ...
    );

    void loadWidget(WidgetTester tester) async {
      await testApp(
        tester,
        ChangeNotifierProvider.value(
          value: FakeAuthRepository() as AuthRepository,
          child: Provider.value(
            value: FakeItineraryConfigRepository() as ItineraryConfigRepository,
            child: HomeScreen(viewModel: viewModel),
          ),
        ),
        goRouter: goRouter,
      );
    }

    // ...
  });
}
```

This method turns around and calls `testApp`,
a generalized method used for all widget tests in the compass app.
It looks like this:

```dart title=testing/app.dart
void testApp(
  WidgetTester tester,
  Widget body, {
  GoRouter? goRouter,
}) async {
  tester.view.devicePixelRatio = 1.0;
  await tester.binding.setSurfaceSize(const Size(1200, 800));
  await mockNetworkImages(() async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(
      MaterialApp(
        localizationsDelegates: [
          GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
          GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
          AppLocalizationDelegate(),
        ],
        theme: AppTheme.lightTheme,
        home: InheritedGoRouter(
          goRouter: goRouter ?? MockGoRouter(),
          child: Scaffold(
            body: body,
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  });
}
```

This function's only job is to create a widget tree that can be tested.

The `loadWidget` method passes in the unique parts of a widget tree for testing.
In this case, that includes the `HomeScreen` and its view model,
as well as some additional faked repositories that
are higher in the widget tree.

The most important thing to take away is that view and view model tests
only require mocking repositories if your architecture is sound.

## Testing the data layer

Similar to the UI layer, the components of the data layer have
well-defined inputs and outputs, making both sides fake-able.
To write unit tests for any given repository,
mock the services that it depends on.
The following example shows a unit test for the `BookingRepository`.

```dart title=booking_repository_remote_test.dart
void main() {
  group('BookingRepositoryRemote tests', () {
    late BookingRepository bookingRepository;
    late FakeApiClient fakeApiClient;

    setUp(() {
      fakeApiClient = FakeApiClient();
      bookingRepository = BookingRepositoryRemote(
        apiClient: fakeApiClient,
      );
    });

    test('should get booking', () async {
      final result = await bookingRepository.getBooking(0);
      final booking = result.asOk.value;
      expect(booking, kBooking);
    });
  });
}
```
