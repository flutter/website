## Why do I see a survey announcement?
If you have not opted-out of Flutter's
[analytics and crash reporting](/reference/crash-reporting),
you may receive a survey announcement in your IDE.

We run two types of surveys:
1. **Each quarter.** We give all active Flutter and Dart users
  the option to take this survey.
2. **Ad-hoc.** We design and deploy experimental surveys
  when we want to learn more about specific topics.
  If your telemetry data meets the survey criteria,
  you might see a survey announcement.

## How will my responses be used?

We use the responses you submit via survey to improve
Flutter and Dart. We store this information independent
of the information sent to Google via analytics.
To see how we used prior surveys to improve Flutter and Dart,
check out our blogs on [Medium][].

## How can I disable it?

To mute survey announcements, you might do one of the following:

1. Click the button on the message.
2. Opt-out of analytics and crash reporting per the steps
  given in
  [Disabling
analytics reporting](/reference/crash-reporting#disabling-analytics-reporting).
