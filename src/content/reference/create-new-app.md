## VS Code

To create a Flutter app with [VS Code][] and other Code OSS editors,
you first need to [install Flutter][flutter-setup] and
[set up VS Code][vscode-setup] for Flutter development.
Then follow these steps:

 1. <h3>Launch VS Code</h3>

    Open VS Code or your preferred Code OSS editor.

 1. <h3>Open the command palette</h3>

    Go to **View** <span aria-label="and then">></span> **Command Palette** or
    press <kbd class="special-key">Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> +
    <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>.

 1. <h3>Find the Flutter commands</h3>

    In the command palette, start typing `flutter:`.
    VS Code should surface commands from the Flutter plugin.

 1. <h3>Run the new project command</h3>

    Select the **Flutter: New Project** command.
    Your OS or VS Code might ask for access to your documents,
    agree to continue to the next step.

 1. <h3>Choose a template</h3>

    VS Code should prompt you with **Which Flutter template?**.
    Depending on what type of Flutter project you want to create,
    choose the corresponding template.
    For a new Flutter app, choose **Application**.

 1. <h3>Select a project location</h3>

    A file dialog will appear.
    Select or create the parent directory where the project will be created.
    Do not create the project folder itself, the Flutter tool will do so.
    To confirm your selection,
    click **Select a folder to create the project in**.

 1. <h3>Enter a project name</h3>

    VS Code should prompt you to enter a name for your new project.
    Enter a name for your app that follows the `lowercase_with_underscores`
    naming convention, following the [Effective Dart][package-name] guidelines.
    To confirm your selection, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

 1. <h3>Wait for project initialization</h3>

    Based on the information you entered,
    VS Code will use `flutter create` to bootstrap your application.
    Progress is often surfaced as a notification in the bottom right
    and can also be accessed from the **Output** panel.

 1. <h3>Run your app</h3>

    Your new app should now be created and open in VS Code.
    To try your new app,
    follow the steps to [run and debug][vscode-run] in VS Code.

    Click **Next** to continue to project configuration.
    Multiple configuration options should appear.

    In the **Project name** field, enter a name for your app that
    follows the `lowercase_with_underscores` naming convention,
    following the [Effective Dart][package-name] guidelines.

    If you're not creating an application,
    select another template from the **Project type** dropdown.

## Project IDX

To create a Flutter app with [Project IDX][idx],
you first need a Google account and to [set up IDX][idx-setup].
Then follow these steps:

 1. <h3>Launch Project IDX</h3>

    In your preferred browser, navigate to the [IDX dashboard][]
    found at `idx.google.com`.

## Terminal

To create a Flutter app in your terminal,
you first need to install and [set up Flutter][flutter-setup].
Then follow these steps:

 1. <h3>Open your terminal</h3>

    Open your preferred method to access the command line,
    such as Terminal on macOS or PowerShell on Windows.

 1. <h3>Navigate to the desired directory</h3>

    Ensure your current working directory
    is the desired parent directory for your new app.
    Do not create the project folder, the `flutter` tool will do so.

 1. <h3>Configure project creation</h3>

    In your terminal, type out the `flutter create` command and
    pass in any desired flags and options to configure your project.
    For example, to create an app with a minimal `main.dart` file,
    you can add the `--empty` option:

    ```console
    $ flutter create --empty
    ```

    To learn about the available creation options,
    run `flutter create --help` in another terminal window.

 1. <h3>Enter a project name</h3>

    As the only non-option argument to `flutter create`,
    specify the directory and default name for your application.
    The name should follow the `lowercase_with_underscores` naming convention,
    following the [Effective Dart][package-name] guidelines.

    For example, if you wanted to create an app named `my_app`:

    ```console
    $ flutter create my_app
    ```

 1. <h3>Execute the configured command</h3>

    To create a project with your specified configuration,
    run the command you built in the previous step.

 1. <h3>Wait for project initialization</h3>

    The `flutter` tool will now bootstrap your project's file structure
    and retrieve any necessary dependencies.
    This might take a while.

 1. <h3>Navigate into the project directory</h3>

    Now that your project has been created,
    you can navigate to it in your terminal or your preferred editor.
    For example, with a bash shell and a project named `my_app`:

    ```console
    $ cd my_app
    ```

 1. <h3>Run your app</h3>

    To try your new app,
    run the `flutter run` command in your terminal and
    respond to its prompts to select an output device.
