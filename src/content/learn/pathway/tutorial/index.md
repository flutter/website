Welcome to the Flutter tutorial! This tutorial teaches you how to build
applications from scratch that run on mobile, desktop, and web.

You'll start from the very beginning: creating a blank Flutter application.
By the end, you'll have built a handful of small apps that demonstrate
the critical features of Flutter development (and more!)

### Before you begin

This tutorial is the third step in the Flutter learning pathway, and therefor assumes that you have:
1. A Flutter environment set up
2. Basic understanding of the Dart programming language

If either of those aren't true, please start at the [Learning pathway page](/learn/pathway).
