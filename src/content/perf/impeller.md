:::note
As of the 3.27 release, Impeller is the default
rendering engine for both iOS and Android.

## What is Impeller?

Impeller provides a new rendering runtime for Flutter.
Impeller precompiles a [smaller, simpler set of shaders][]
at Engine-build time so they don't compile at runtime.

For a video introduction to Impeller, check out the following
talk from Google I/O 2023.

Impeller has the following objectives:

* **Predictable performance**:
  Impeller compiles all shaders and reflection offline at build time.
  It builds all pipeline state objects upfront.
  The engine controls caching and caches explicitly.
* **Instrumentable**:
  Impeller tags and labels all graphics resources,
  such as textures and buffers.
  It can capture and persist animations to disk without affecting
  per-frame rendering performance.
* **Portable**:
  Flutter doesn't tie Impeller to a specific client-rendering API.
  You can author shaders once and convert them to backend-specific
  formats, as necessary.
* **Leverages modern graphics APIs**:
  Impeller uses, but doesn't depend on, features available in
  modern APIs like Metal and Vulkan.
* **Leverages concurrency**:
  Impeller can distribute single-frame workloads across multiple
  threads, if necessary.

## Availability

Where can you use Impeller? For _detailed_ info, check out
the [Can I use Impeller?][] page.

### iOS

Flutter **enables Impeller by default** on iOS.

* To _disable_ Impeller on iOS when debugging,
  pass `--no-enable-impeller` to the `flutter run` command.

  ```console
  flutter run --no-enable-impeller
  ```

* To _disable_ Impeller on iOS when deploying your app,
  add the following tags under the top-level `<dict>` tag in your
  app's `Info.plist` file.

  ```xml
    <key>FLTEnableImpeller</key>
    <false />
  ```

### Android

Flutter **enables Impeller by default** on Android.
On devices that don't support Vulkan,
Impeller will fallback to the the legacy OpenGL renderer.
No action on your part is necessary for this fallback behavior.

* To _disable_ Impeller when debugging,
  pass `--no-enable-impeller` to the `flutter run` command.

  ```console
  flutter run --no-enable-impeller
  ```

* To _disable_ Impeller when deploying your app,
  add the following setting to your project's
  `AndroidManifest.xml` file under the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.EnableImpeller"
    android:value="false" />
```

### macOS

You can try out Impeller for macOS behind a flag.
In a future release, the ability to opt-out of
using Impeller will be removed.

To enable Impeller on macOS when debugging,
pass `--enable-impeller` to the `flutter run` command.

```console
flutter run --enable-impeller
```

To enable Impeller on macOS when deploying your app,
add the following tags under the top-level
`<dict>` tag in your app's `Info.plist` file.

```xml
  <key>FLTEnableImpeller</key>
  <true />
```
