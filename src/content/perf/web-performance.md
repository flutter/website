description: Learn how to use Chrome DevTools to debug web performance issues.

:::note
Profiling Flutter web apps requires Flutter version 3.14 or later.
:::

The Flutter framework emits timeline events as it works to build frames,
draw scenes, and track other activity such as garbage collections.
These events are exposed in the
[Chrome DevTools performance panel][] for debugging.

check out the (free) article on Medium,
[Best practices for optimizing Flutter web loading speed][article].

You can also emit your own timeline events using the `dart:developer`
[Timeline][] and [TimelineTask][] APIs for further performance analysis.

## Optional flags to enhance tracing

To configure which timeline events are tracked, set any of the following top-level properties to `true`
in your app's `main` method.

- [debugProfileBuildsEnabled][]: Adds `Timeline` events for every `Widget` built.
- [debugProfileBuildsEnabledUserWidgets][]: Adds `Timeline` events for every user-created `Widget` built.
- [debugProfileLayoutsEnabled][]: Adds `Timeline` events for every `RenderObject` layout.
- [debugProfilePaintsEnabled][]: Adds `Timeline` events for every `RenderObject` painted.

## Instructions

1. _[Optional]_ Set any desired tracing flags to true from your app's main method.
2. Run your Flutter web app in [profile mode][].
3. Open up the [Chrome DevTools Performance panel][] for your application,
    and [start recording][] to capture timeline events.
