**What's coming**

Things that are coming soon-ish to a stable release:

**Material 3**

You've probably heard by now that [Material 3][] is coming.
It's been available on Flutter for some time now,
by setting `useMaterial3: true` in your code.
By the next stable release in Q4,
Material 3 will be enabled by default. Now would
be a good time to start migrating your code.
Most all of the example code on this website
has been updated to use Material 3.

For more information,
check out the following resources:

* [Flutter 3.13 blog post][blog-material]
* [Material Design for Flutter][] page

**Impeller for Android**

Progress continues on Impeller for Android.
For more information, check out the
[Flutter 3.13 blog post][blog-impeller].

**New scrolling APIs**

We have been working on updating our scrolling APIs.
The rework will eventually result in 2D scrolling
support for trees and tables, even diagonal scrolling!
Flutter 3.13 also provides new Sliver classes for fancy scrolling.
For more information, check out the
[Flutter 3.13 blog post][blog-scrolling].

**Updates to the Games toolkit**

We are working on updates to the Flutter Games toolkit,
including the sample code, additional docs, and a new video.
The Games toolkit is developed independently of the
Flutter SDK, so stay tuned for updates as they are ready.
For  more information,
check out the [Flutter 3.13 blog post][blog-games].

**Codelabs and workshops**

We have new codelabs since the last stable release:

* [Your first Flutter app][]<br>
  Learn about Flutter as you build an application that
  generates cool-sounding names, such as "newstay",
  "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine".
  The user can ask for the next name, favorite the current one,
  and review the list of favorited names on a separate page.
  The final app is responsive to different screen sizes.
  (Note that this codelab replaces the previous "Write
  your first Flutter codelab for mobile, part 1 and part 2.")
* [Using FFI in a Flutter plugin][]<br>
  Dart's FFI (foreign function interface) allows Flutter apps
  to use of existing native libraries that expose a C API.
  Dart supports FFI on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* [Building a game with Flutter and Flame][]<br>
  Learn how to build a platformer game with Flutter and Flame!
  In the Doodle Dash game, inspired by Doodle Jump,
  you play as either Dash (the Flutter mascot),
  or her best friend Sparky (the Firebase mascot),
  and try to reach as high as possible by jumping on platforms.
* [Add a user authentication flow to a Flutter app using FirebaseUI][]<br>
  Learn how to add Firebase Authentication to your Flutter app
  using the FlutterFire UI package. You'll add both email/password
  and Google Sign In authorization to a Flutter app. You'll also learn
  how to set up a Firebase project,
  and use the FlutterFire CLI to initialize Firebase in your Flutter app.
* [Local development for your Flutter apps using the Firebase Emulator Suite][]<br>
  Learn how to use the Firebase Emulator Suite with Flutter during local development,
  including how to use email-password authentication with the Emulator Suite,
  and how to read and write data to the Firestore emulator. Also, you'll import
  and export data from the emulators, to work with the same faked data each
  time you return to development.

In addition, we've updated all of our existing
codelabs to support multiplatform.
The [codelabs & workshops][] page is updated
to reflect the latest available codelabs.

  and `Router` together, named routes, and
  using a routing package.
* The [URL strategies][] page has also been updated
  to reflect a more streamlined API.
* For apps not published to the Microsoft Store, you
  can now set the app's executable's file and
  product versions in the pubspec file.
  For more information, see
  [Build and release a Windows desktop app][].
* If you are developing software for iOS 16 and higher,
  you must enable [Developer mode][].
  The [macOS install][] page is updated
  with this information.
* As described in the [3.3 release notes][],
  you should catch all errors and exceptions
  in your app by setting
  the `PlatformDispatcher.onError` callback,
  instead of using a custom `Zone`.
  The [Handling errors in Flutter][]
  page has been updated with this advice.

  to bind your app to native code (a feature currently under
  development).

  and profile a session from your Dart/Flutter application,
  has been enabled in DevTools. For more information,
  see the [Performance view][] page.
* A new page on
  [building a web application][].
* A new page on [creating responsive apps][] in Flutter.
* A new page on [preparing a web app for release][].
* A new [web FAQ][].

  flutter_web package, the following instructions tell
  you how to migrate to the flutter package:
  Upgrading from package:flutter_web to the Flutter SDK.

  [ToggleButtons demo][]
* A new [`ColorFiltered`][] widget, also described in the API docs.
  [ColorFiltered demo][]

New and updated docs on the site include:

  page is updated to discuss how to build an Android release
  using an app bundle, as well as how to create separate APK
  files for both 32-bit and 64-bit devices.
* The [DevTools][] docs are migrated to flutter.dev.
  If you haven't tried this browser-based suite
  of debugging, performance, memory, and inspection tools that
  work with both Flutter and Dart apps and can be launched from

* The [Simple app state management][] page is updated.

component, which allows the user to select both the upper and lower
endpoints in a range of values. For information about this
component and how to customize it, see
[Material RangeSlider in Flutter].

Flutter released [version 1.2][] at Mobile World Congress
(MWC) in Barcelona. For more information, see the
[1.2.1 release notes][] or [download the release][].

  New pages include an [introduction][],
  [thinking declaratively][], [ephemeral vs app state][],
  [simple app state management][], and
  [different state management options].
  Documenting state management is a tricky thing, as there is no
  one-size-fits-all approach. We'd love your feedback on these new docs!
* A new page on [Performance best practices][].
* Also at MWC, we announced a preview version of the new Dart DevTools
  for profiling and debugging Dart and Flutter apps.
  You can find the docs on the DevTools wiki
  (Note: since moved to [this site][].)
  In particular, check out the DevTool's [widget inspector][] for
  debugging your UI, or the [timeline view][] for profiling your Flutter
  application. Try them out and let us know what you think!
* An update to the [Performance profiling][]
  page that incorporates the new Dart DevTools UI.
* Updates to the [Android Studio/IntelliJ][]
  and [VS Code][] pages incorporating info from
  the new Dart DevTools UI.
