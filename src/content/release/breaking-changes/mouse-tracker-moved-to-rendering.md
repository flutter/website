## Summary

[`MouseTracker`][] and related symbols are moved from the
`gestures` package, resulting in error messages such as
undefined classes or methods. Import them from `rendering`
package instead.

## Context

Prior to this change [`MouseTracker`][] was part of the
`gestures` package. This brought troubles when we found out
that code related to [`MouseTracker`][] often wanted to
import from the `rendering` package.

Since [`MouseTracker`][] turned out to be more connected to
`rendering` than `gestures`, we have moved it and its
related code to `rendering`.

## Description of change

The file `mouse_tracking.dart` has been moved from the
`gestures` package to `rendering`. All symbols in the said
file have been moved without keeping backward compatibility.

## Migration guide

If you see error of "Undefined class" or "Undefined name" of
the following symbols:

* [`MouseDetectorAnnotationFinder`][]
* [`MouseTracker`][]
* [`MouseTrackerAnnotation`][]
* [`PointerEnterEventListener`][]
* [`PointerExitEventListener`][]
* [`PointerHoverEventListener`][]

You should add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/rendering.dart';
```
