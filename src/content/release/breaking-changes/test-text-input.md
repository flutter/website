## Summary

The state of a `TestTextInput` instance,
a stub for the system's onscreen keyboard,
is now reset between tests.

## Context

The Flutter test framework uses a class called `TestTextInput`
to track and manipulate editing state in a widgets test.
Individual tests can make calls that modify the internal
state of this object, sometimes indirectly (such as
by setting their own handlers on `SystemChannels.textInput`).
Subsequent tests might then check the state of
`WidgetTester.testTextInput` and get unexpected values.

## Description of change

The state of `WidgetTester.testTextInput`
is now reset before running a `testWidgets` test.

## Migration guide

Tests that relied on dirty state from a previously run
test must be updated. For example, the following test,
from `packages/flutter/test/material/text_field_test.dart`
in the `'Controller can update server'` test,
previously passed because of a combination of dirty state
from previous tests and a failure to actually set state
in cases where it should have been set.

Code before migration:

In a `widgetsTest`, before actually changing text on a
text editing widget, this call might have succeeded:

```dart
    expect(tester.testTextInput.editingState['text'], isEmpty);
```

Code after migration:

Either remove the call entirely, or consider using the
following to assert that the state hasn't been modified yet:

```dart
    expect(tester.testTextInput.editingState, isNull);
```
