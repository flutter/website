  How to migrate your Android app if you experience
  a run or build error from Gradle.

## Summary

If you've recently upgraded Android Studio to the Flamingo
release and have either run or built an existing Android app,
you might have run into an error similar to the following:

![Error dialog in Android Studio Flamingo: MultipleCompilationErrorsException](/assets/images/docs/releaseguide/android-studio-flamingo-error.png){:width="80%"}

The terminal output for this error is
similar to the following:


```sh
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Build file '…/example/android/build.gradle'
* What went wrong:
Could not compile build file '…/example/android/build.gradle'.
> startup failed:
  General error during conversion: Unsupported class file major version 61

  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported class file major version 61
  	at groovyjarjarasm.asm.ClassReader.<init>(ClassReader.java:189)
  	at groovyjarjarasm.asm.ClassReader.<init>(ClassReader.java:170)
  	[…

  	 …]
  	at java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:833)
```

This error occurs because Android Studio Flamingo
updates its bundled Java SDK from 11 to 17.
Flutter uses the version of Java bundled with
Android Studio to build Android apps.
Gradle versions [prior to 7.3][] can't run
when using Java 17.

**You can fix this error by upgrading your Gradle project
to a compatible version (7.3 through 7.6.1, inclusive)
using one of the following approaches.**

[prior to 7.3]: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html#java

## Solution #1: Guided fix using Android Studio

Upgrade the Gradle version in Android Studio Flamingo
as follows:

1. In Android Studio, open the `android` folder.
   This should bring up the following dialog: 

   ![Dialog prompting you to upgrade Gradle](/assets/images/docs/releaseguide/android-studio-flamingo-upgrade-alert.png){:width="50%"}

   Update to a Gradle release between 7.3 through 7.6.1, inclusive.

1. Follow the guided workflow to update Gradle.

## Solution #2: Manual fix at the command line

Do the following from the top of your Flutter project.

1. Go to the Android directory for your project.

   ```console
   $ cd android
   ```

1. Update Gradle to the preferred version. Choose between 7.3 through 7.6.1, inclusive.

   ```console
   $ ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=7.6.1
   ```

## Notes

A few notes to be aware of:

* Repeat this step for each affected Android app.
* This issue can be experienced by those who
  _don't_ download Java and the Android SDK through
  Android studio.
  If you've manually upgraded your Java SDK to
  version 17 but haven't upgraded Gradle, you can
  also encounter this issue. The fix is the same:
  upgrade Gradle to a release between 7.3 and 7.6.1.
* Your development machine _might_ contain more
  than one copy of the Java SDK:
  * The Android Studio app includes a version of Java,
    which Flutter uses by default.
  * If you don't have Android Studio installed,
    Flutter relies on the version defined by your
    shell script's `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
  * If `JAVA_HOME` isn't defined, Flutter looks
    for any `java` executable in your path.
    Once [issue 122609][] lands, the `flutter doctor -v`
    command reports which version of Java is used.
* If you upgrade Gradle to a release _newer_ than 7.6.1,
  you might (though it's unlikely) encounter issues
  that result from changes to Gradle, such as
  [deprecated Gradle classes][], or changes to the
  Android file structure, such as
  [splitting out ApplicationId from PackageName][].
  If this occurs, downgrade to a release of Gradle
  between 7.3 and 7.6.1, inclusive.
* Upgrading to Flutter 3.10 won't fix this issue.
