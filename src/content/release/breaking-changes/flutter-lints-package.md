title: Introducing package:flutter_lints
description: >
  Migrate to package:flutter_lints to get the latest set of
  recommended lints, which encourage good coding practices.
---

## Summary

The [`package:flutter_lints`][] defines the latest set of recommended lints
that encourage good coding practices for Flutter apps, packages, and plugins.
Projects created with `flutter create` using Flutter version 2.5 or newer are
already enabled to use the latest set of recommended lints. Projects created
prior to that version can upgrade to it with the instructions in this guide.

## Context

Prior to the introduction of `package:flutter_lints`, the Flutter framework
shipped with a set of lints defined in [`analysis_options_user.yaml`][] that was
used by the [dart analyzer][] to identify code issues if a Flutter project
didn't define a custom `analysis_options.yaml` file.
Since `analysis_options_user.yaml` was tied to a particular framework version,
it was difficult to evolve without breaking
existing apps, packages, and plugins. As a result of that, the lints
defined in `analysis_options_user.yaml` are heavily outdated. To fix this,
`package:flutter_lints` was created. The package versions the lint set to enable
evolving it without breaking existing projects. Since the package builds on
Dart's [`package:lints`][] it also aligns the lints recommended for Flutter
projects with the rest of the Dart ecosystem.

## Migration guide

Follow these steps to migrate your Flutter project to use the latest recommended
lints from `package:flutter_lints`:

Add a dev_dependency on `package:flutter_lints` to your project's `pubspec.yaml`
by running `flutter pub add --dev flutter_lints` in the root directory of the
project.

Create an `analysis_options.yaml` file in the root directory of your project
(next to the `pubspec.yaml` file) with the following content:

```yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml
```

The newly activated lint set may identify some new issues in your code. To find
them, open your project in an [IDE with Dart support][] or run `flutter analyze`
on the command line. You may be able to fix some of the reported issues
automatically by running `dart fix --apply` in the root directory of your
project.

### Existing custom analysis_options.yaml file

If your project already has a custom `analysis_options.yaml` file at its root,
add `include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml` to it at the top to activate
the lints from `package:flutter_lints`. If your `analysis_options.yaml` already
contains an `include:` directive you have to decide whether you want to keep
those lints or whether you want to replace it with the lints from
`package:flutter_lints` because the Dart analyzer only supports one `include:`
directive per `analysis_options.yaml` file.

## Customizing the lints

The lints activated for a given project can be further customized in the
`analysis_options.yaml` file. This is shown in the example file below, which is
a reproduction of the `analysis_options.yaml` file generated by `flutter create`
for new projects.

```yaml
# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at
  # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/index.html.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule

# Additional information about this file can be found at
# https://dart.dev/guides/language/analysis-options
```
