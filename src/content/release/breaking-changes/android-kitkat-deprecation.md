## Context

The context, purpose, and description of this deprecation can be found in
the [go/rfc-android-k-deprecation][] design document.

Flutter developers targeting Android will need to increase the
`minSdkVersion` in their `build.gradle` and `AndroidManifest.xml` files
from `19` to at least `21`.
