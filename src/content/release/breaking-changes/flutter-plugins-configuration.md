title: .flutter-plugins-dependencies replaces .flutter-plugins.
description: >-
  The deprecated `.flutter-plugins` tool file output has been replaced by
  `.flutter-plugins-dependencies`, and any build scripts or references to it
  must also be updated.
---

## Summary

The `flutter` tool will no longer output the legacy `.flutter-plugins` metadata
file, and only output `.flutter-plugins-dependencies`. Tools and build scripts,
such as Gradle configurations (for Android apps) that rely on the presence of
`.flutter-plugins` will need to be updated.

## Background

[In 2019][PR 45379] `.flutter-plugins-dependencies` was added as a newer file
format that replaces `.flutter-plugins`.

So a file that looked something like this:

```txt
# This is .flutter-plugins
camera=/path/to/camera/plugin
shared_preferences=shared_preferences
```

... was replaced by something like this:

```json
{
  "dependencyGraph": {
    "camera": {
      "name": "camera",
      "version": "0.10.0",
      "dependencies": {
        "flutter": "0.0.0"
      }
    },
    "shared_preferences": {
      "name": "shared_preferences",
      "version": "2.0.15",
      "dependencies": {
        "flutter": "0.0.0"
      }
    }
  },
  "flutter": {
    "frameworkRevision": "3a0f99d4f2",
    "channel": "stable"
  }
}
```

Having both files output is a source of technical debt that complicates new
feature sets like not bundling `dev_dependency` plugins in a release app.

## Migration guide

Most Flutter developers don't parse or use this file, but build configurations
(such as `settings.gradle`), as generated by older invocations of
`flutter create --platforms android`. These legacy files might still reference `.flutter-plugins` and
must be updated to a newer build script.

For example:

```groovy
include ':app'

def flutterProjectRoot = rootProject.projectDir.parentFile.toPath()

def plugins = new Properties()
// Note explicitly reading the legacy '.flutter-plugins' file.
def pluginsFile = new File(flutterProjectRoot.toFile(), '.flutter-plugins')
if (pluginsFile.exists()) {
    pluginsFile.withReader('UTF-8') { reader -> plugins.load(reader) }
}

plugins.each { name, path ->
    def pluginDirectory = flutterProjectRoot.resolve(path).resolve('android').toFile()
    include ":$name"
    project(":$name").projectDir = pluginDirectory
}
```

... might be upgraded to its `settings.gradle.kts` equivalent:

```kts
pluginManagement {
    val flutterSdkPath = run {
        val properties = java.util.Properties()
        file("local.properties").inputStream().use { properties.load(it) }
        val flutterSdkPath = properties.getProperty("flutter.sdk")
        require(flutterSdkPath != null) { "flutter.sdk not set in local.properties" }
        flutterSdkPath
    }

    includeBuild("$flutterSdkPath/packages/flutter_tools/gradle")

    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}

plugins {
    // Note the use of the flutter-plugin-loader versus reading '.flutter-plugins'
    id("dev.flutter.flutter-plugin-loader") version "1.0.0"
    id("com.android.application") version "8.1.0" apply false
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.android") version "1.8.22" apply false
}

include(":app")
```

See [Deprecated imperative apply of Flutter's Gradle plugins][imperative-apply]
for details of switching to the newer plugin DSL.

To smoke test whether your build relies on a `.flutter-plugins` file, you
can use the flag `--no-implicit-pubspec-resolution`:

```sh
flutter build apk --no-implicit-pubspec-resolution
```

Any build tools or scripts that might rely on that file being output will now
fail.
