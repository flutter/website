title: Deprecated imperative apply of Flutter's Gradle plugins
description: >-
  How to migrate your Flutter app's Android Gradle build files to the
  new, declarative format.
---

## Summary

To build a Flutter app for Android, Flutter's Gradle plugins must be applied.
Historically, this was done imperatively with Gradle's
[legacy, imperative apply script method][].

In Flutter 3.16, support was added for applying these plugins with Gradle's
[declarative plugins {} block][] (also called the Plugin DSL) and it is
now the recommended approach. Since Flutter 3.16, projects generated with
`flutter create` use the Plugin DSL to apply Gradle plugins. Projects created
with versions of Flutter prior to 3.16 need to be migrated manually.

Applying Gradle plugins using the `plugins {}` block executes the same code as
before and should produce equivalent app binaries.

To learn about advantages the new Plugin DSL syntax has over the legacy `apply`
script syntax, see [Gradle docs][plugins block].

Migrating the app ecosystem to use the new approach will also make it easier for
Flutter team to develop Flutter's Gradle plugins, and to enable exciting new
features in the future, such as using Kotlin instead of Groovy in Gradle
buildscripts.

## Migrate

### android/settings.gradle

First, find the values of the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP)
and Kotlin that the project currently uses.
Unless they have been moved,
they are likely defined in the buildscript block of the 
`<app-src>/android/build.gradle` file.
As an example, consider the `build.gradle` file from 
a new Flutter app created before this change:

```groovy
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10'
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.0'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

rootProject.buildDir = '../build'
subprojects {
    project.buildDir = "${rootProject.buildDir}/${project.name}"
}
subprojects {
    project.evaluationDependsOn(':app')
}

tasks.register("clean", Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
```

The AGP version is the number that comes at the end of the line 
`classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.0'`, so `7.3.0` 
in this case. Similarly, the Kotlin version comes at the end of the line
`ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10'`, in this case `1.7.10`.

Next, replace the contents of
`<app-src>/android/settings.gradle` with the following,
remembering to replace `{agpVersion}` and `{kotlinVersion}` with previously
identified values:

```groovy
pluginManagement {
    def flutterSdkPath = {
        def properties = new Properties()
        file("local.properties").withInputStream { properties.load(it) }
        def flutterSdkPath = properties.getProperty("flutter.sdk")
        assert flutterSdkPath != null, "flutter.sdk not set in local.properties"
        return flutterSdkPath
    }()

    includeBuild("$flutterSdkPath/packages/flutter_tools/gradle")

    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}

plugins {
    id "dev.flutter.flutter-plugin-loader" version "1.0.0"
    id "com.android.application" version "{agpVersion}" apply false
    id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "{kotlinVersion}" apply false
}

include ":app"
```

If you made some changes to this file, make sure they're placed after
`pluginManagement {}` and `plugins {}` blocks, since Gradle enforces
that no other code can be placed before these blocks.

### android/build.gradle

Remove the whole `buildscript` block from `<app-src/android/build.gradle`:

```groovy diff
- buildscript {
-     ext.kotlin_version = '{kotlinVersion}'
-     repositories {
-         google()
-         mavenCentral()
-     }
-
-     dependencies {
-         classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
-     }
- }
```

Here's how that file will likely end up:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

rootProject.buildDir = '../build'
subprojects {
    project.buildDir = "${rootProject.buildDir}/${project.name}"
}
subprojects {
    project.evaluationDependsOn(':app')
}

tasks.register("clean", Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
```

### android/app/build.gradle

The following changes to code that is, by default
found in `<app-src>/android/app/build.gradle`, also need to be made.
First, remove the following 2 chunks of code that use the
legacy imperative apply method:

```groovy diff
- def flutterRoot = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.sdk')
- if (flutterRoot == null) {
-     throw new GradleException("Flutter SDK not found. Define location with flutter.sdk in the local.properties file.")
- }
```

```groovy diff
- apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
- apply plugin: 'com.jetbrains.kotlin.android'
- apply from: "$flutterRoot/packages/flutter_tools/gradle/flutter.gradle"
```

Now apply the plugins again,
but this time using the Plugin DSL syntax.
At the very top of your file, add:

```groovy
plugins {
    id "com.android.application"
    id "kotlin-android"
    id "dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin"
}
```

Finally, if your `dependencies` block contains a dependency
on `"org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:$kotlin_version"`, 
then remove that dependency.

```groovy diff
  dependencies {
-     implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:$kotlin_version"
  }
```
If it was the only dependency in the `dependencies` block,
then you can instead remove the block entirely.

### Validation

Execute `flutter run` to confirm that your app builds and
launches on a connected Android device or emulator.

## Examples

### Google Mobile Services and Crashlytics

If your app was using Google Mobile Services and Crashlytics,
remove the following lines from `<app-src>/android/build.gradle`:

```groovy diff
  buildscript {
      // ...

      dependencies {
          // ...
-         classpath "com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.0"
-         classpath "com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.9.9"
      }
  }
```

Then remove these 2 lines from `<app-src>/android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy diff
- apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
- apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'
```

To migrate to the new, declarative-apply syntax for
the GMS and Crashlytics plugins, add them to `plugins` block
in your app's `<app-src>/android/settings.gradle` file.
The additions should look similar to the following,
but with your desired plugin versions, likely matching
the ones you removed from the `<app-src>/android/build.gradle` file.

```groovy diff
  plugins {
      id "dev.flutter.flutter-plugin-loader" version "1.0.0"
      id "com.android.application" version "{agpVersion}" apply false
      id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "{kotlinVersion}" apply false
+     id "com.google.gms.google-services" version "4.4.0" apply false
+     id "com.google.firebase.crashlytics" version "2.9.9" apply false
  }
```

Add the following lines to `<app-src>/android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy diff
  plugins {
      id "com.android.application"
      id "dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin"
      id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android"
+     id "com.google.gms.google-services"
+     id "com.google.firebase.crashlytics"
  }
```

## Timeline

Recommended in stable release: 3.19.0
