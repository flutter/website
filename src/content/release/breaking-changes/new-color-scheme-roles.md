title: Introduce new ColorScheme roles for Material 3
description: >-
  'ColorScheme' introduces new color roles to
  better align with Material Design 3.
  The 'ColorScheme.fromSeed' method is also updated to
  support the newly added colors.
---

## Summary

New color roles in `ColorScheme` include
seven tone-based surfaces and containers, and twelve accent colors for
primary, secondary, and tertiary groups.
This update deprecates three existing color roles:
`background`, `onBackground`, and `surfaceVariant`.
The `ColorScheme` constructed by the updated `ColorScheme.fromSeed` method now
generates different values compared to the previous version,
adapting to the Material Design 3 guidelines.

## Background

The tone-based surface colors include: 

- `surfaceBright`
- `surfaceDim`
- `surfaceContainer`
- `surfaceContainerLow`
- `surfaceContainerLowest`
- `surfaceContainerHigh`
- `surfaceContainerHighest`

These changes help eliminate the use of widgets' `surfaceTintColor`, and
replaces the old opacity-based model that applied a tinted overlay
on top of surfaces based on their elevation.  

The default `surfaceTintColor` for all widgets is now `null` and
their default background color is now
based on the new tone-based surface colors.

`ColorScheme.fromSeed` has also been updated to use the latest algorithm
from the [Material color utilities][] package.
This change prevents the constructed `ColorScheme` from being too bright,
even if the source color looks bright and
had a high chroma (contained little black, white, and shades of grey).

## Migration guide

The differences caused by the updated `ColorScheme.fromSeed` and
the new color roles should be small and acceptable.
However, when providing a brighter seed color to `ColorScheme.fromSeed`,
it might construct a relatively darker version of `ColorScheme`.
To force the output to still be bright,
set `dynamicSchemeVariant: DynamicSchemeVariant.fidelity` in
`ColorScheme.fromSeed`. For example:

Code before migration:

```dart
ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: Color(0xFF0000FF), // Bright blue
)
```

Code after migration:

```dart
ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: Color(0xFF0000FF), // Bright blue
    dynamicSchemeVariant: DynamicSchemeVariant.fidelity,
)
```

Material Design 3 removes 3 colors.

To configure the appearance of the material components,
`background` should be replaced with `surface`,
`onBackground` should be replaced with `onSurface`, and
`surfaceVariant` should be migrated to `surfaceContainerHighest`.

Code before migration:

```dart
final ColorScheme colorScheme = ColorScheme();
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    //...
    colorScheme: colorScheme.copyWith(
      background: myColor1,
      onBackground: myColor2,
      surfaceVariant: myColor3,
    ),
  ),
  //...
)
```

Code after migration:

```dart
final ColorScheme colorScheme = ColorScheme();
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    //...
    colorScheme: colorScheme.copyWith(
      surface: myColor1,
      onSurface: myColor2,
      surfaceContainerHighest: myColor3,
    ),
  ),
  //...
)
```

Custom components that used to look up `ColorScheme.background`,
`ColorScheme.onBackground`, and `ColorScheme.surfaceVariant` can look up
`ColorScheme.surface`, `ColorScheme.onSurface` and
`ColorScheme.surfaceContainerHighest` instead.

Code before migration:

```dart
Color myColor1 = Theme.of(context).colorScheme.background;
Color myColor2 = Theme.of(context).colorScheme.onBackground;
Color myColor3 = Theme.of(context).colorScheme.surfaceVariant;
```

Code after migration:

```dart
Color myColor1 = Theme.of(context).colorScheme.surface;
Color myColor2 = Theme.of(context).colorScheme.onSurface;
Color myColor3 = Theme.of(context).colorScheme.surfaceContainerHighest;
```
