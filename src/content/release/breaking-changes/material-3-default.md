## Summary

The Material library has been updated to match
the latest Material Design spec.
Changes include new components, new component themes,
and updated component visuals.
As of this release, [`ThemeData.useMaterial3`][] is set `true` by default.

## Background

Flutter's Material widgets now fully support Material 3 and,
as of Flutter 3.16, Material 3 is now the default style.

The appearance of Material 3 components are primarily determined by
the values for [`ThemeData.colorScheme`][] and [`ThemeData.textTheme`][].
ColorScheme makes it easier to create dark and light schemes so that
your app is both aesthetically pleasing and
compliant with accessibility requirements.
To further customize the appearance of Material 3 components,
add component themes to your `ThemeData`,
such as [`ThemeData.segmentedButtonTheme`][] or [`ThemeData.snackBarTheme`][].

Additionally, Material 3 improves motion by using easing and duration tokens.
This means that Material 2 curves have been renamed to include
the word "legacy" and will eventually be deprecated and removed.

Check out the [Material 3 gallery][] to test out
all the new components and compare them with Material 2.

## Migration guide

Prior to the 3.16 release, the changes were "opt-in"
using the `useMaterial3` theme property on `ThemeData`.
As of this release, `useMaterial3` is `true` by default.
You can still opt out of the Material 3 version of the Material library by
specifying `useMaterial3: false` in your `MaterialApp` theme.

:::note
Support for Material 2 and configuring the `useMaterial3` property
will eventually be deprecated and removed.
:::

Also, some of the widgets couldn't merely be updated,
but needed a whole new implementation.
For this reason, your UI might look a little strange when
you see it running with Material 3.
To fix this, manually migrate to the new widgets, such as [`NavigationBar`][].
