title: Component theme normalization
description: >-
  `CardTheme`, `DialogTheme`, and `TabBarTheme` have been normalized to follow
  Flutter's convention for component themes in the Material library.
---

## Summary

`CardTheme`, `DialogTheme` and `TabBarTheme` were refactored to 
conform to Flutter's conventions for component themes. `CardThemeData`, 
`DialogThemeData` and `TabBarThemeData` were added to define overrides for the
defaults of the component visual properties. Future releases will continue to
normalize component themes like these for a more consistent theming experience
in the material library.

## Migration guide

In `ThemeData`, the type of `cardTheme` property has been changed from
`CardTheme` to `CardThemeData`; the type of `dialogTheme` property has been
changed from `DialogTheme` to `DialogThemeData`; the type of `tabBarTheme`
property has been changed from `TabBarTheme` to `TabBarThemeData`.

The return type of the compoenent theme `xTheme.of()` method and
`Theme.of().xTheme` now has also changed to `xThemeData` accordingly.

Code before migration:

```dart
final CardTheme cardTheme = Theme.of(context).cardTheme;
final CardTheme cardTheme = CardTheme.of(context);

final DialogTheme dialogTheme = Theme.of(context).dialogTheme;
final DialogTheme dialogTheme = DialogTheme.of(context);

final TabBarTheme tabBarTheme = Theme.of(context).tabBarTheme;
final TabBarTheme tabBarTheme = TabBarTheme.of(context);
```

Code after migration:

```dart
final CardThemeData cardTheme = Theme.of(context).cardTheme;
final CardThemeData cardTheme = CardTheme.of(context);

final DialogThemeData dialogTheme = Theme.of(context).dialogTheme;
final DialogThemeData dialogTheme = DialogTheme.of(context);

final TabBarThemeData tabBarTheme = Theme.of(context).tabBarTheme;
final TabBarThemeData tabBarTheme = TabBarTheme.of(context);
```
