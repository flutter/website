title: Using HTML slots to render platform views in the web

  iframes in Flutter web used to reload, because of

  A change in the way Flutter web apps render platform views
  makes them stable (preventing iframe reloads, and other problems
  with video tags or forms potentially losing their state).

## Summary

Flutter now renders all web platform views in a consistent location of the DOM,
as direct children of `flt-glass-pane` (regardless of the rendering backend:
`html` or `canvaskit`). Platform views are then _"slotted"_ into the correct
position of the App's DOM with standard HTML features.

Up until this change, Flutter web would change the styling of the rendered
contents of a platform views to position/size it to the available space. **This
is no longer the case.** Users can now decide how they want to utilize the space
allocated to their platform view by the framework.

## Context

The Flutter framework frequently tweaks its render tree to optimize the paint
operations that are ultimately made per frame. In the web, these render tree
changes often result in DOM operations.

Flutter web used to render its platform views ([`HtmlElementView` widgets][])
directly into its corresponding position of the DOM.

Using certain DOM elements as the "target" of some DOM operations causes those
elements to lose their internal state. In practice, this means that `iframe`
tags are going to reload, `video` players might restart, or an editable form
might lose its edits.

Flutter now renders platform views using [slot elements][] inside of a single,
app-wide [shadow root][]. Slot elements can be added/removed/moved around the
Shadow DOM without affecting the underlying slotted content (which is rendered
in a constant location)

This change was made to:

* Stabilize the behavior of platform views in Flutter web.
* Unify how platform views are rendered in the web for both rendering
   backends (`html` and `canvaskit`).
* Provide a predictable location in the DOM that allows developers to reliably
   use CSS to style their platform views, and to use other standard DOM API,
   such as `querySelector`, and `getElementById`.

## Description of change

A Flutter web app is now rendered inside a common [shadow root][] in which
[slot elements][] represent platform views. The actual content of
each platform view is rendered as a **sibling of said shadow root**.

### Before

```html
...

<flt-glass-pane>
  ...
  <div id="platform-view">Contents</div> <!-- canvaskit -->
  <!-- OR -->
  <flt-platform-view>
    #shadow-root
    | <div id="platform-view">Contents</div> <!-- html -->
  </flt-platform-view>
  ...
</flt-glass-pane>

...
```

### After

```html
...

<flt-glass-pane>
  #shadow-root
  | ...
  | <flt-platform-view-slot>
  |   <slot name="platform-view-1" />
  | </flt-platform-view-slot>
  | ...
  <flt-platform-view slot="platform-view-1">
    <div id="platform-view">Contents</div>
  </flt-platform-view>
  ...
</flt-glass-pane>

...
```

After this change, when the framework needs to move DOM nodes around, it
operates over `flt-platform-view-slot`s, which only contain a `slot` element.
The slot _projects_ the contents defined in `flt-platform-view` elements outside
the shadow root. `flt-platform-view` elements are never the target of DOM
operations from the framework, thus preventing the reload issues.

From an app's perspective, this change is transparent. **However**, this is
considered a _breaking change_ because some tests make assumptions
about the internal DOM of a Flutter web app, and break.

## Migration guide

### Code

The engine may print a warning message to the console similar to:

```bash
Height of Platform View type: [$viewType] may not be set. Defaulting to `height: 100%`.
Set `style.height` to any appropriate value to stop this message.
```

or:

```bash
Width of Platform View type: [$viewType] may not be set. Defaulting to `width: 100%`.
Set `style.width` to any appropriate value to stop this message.
```

Previously, the content returned by [`PlatformViewFactory` functions][] was
resized and positioned by the framework. Instead, Flutter now sizes and
positions `<flt-platform-view-slot>`, which is the parent of the slot where the
content is projected.

To stop the warning above, platform views need to set the `style.width` and
`style.height` of their root element to any appropriate (non-null) value.

For example, to make the root `html.Element` fill all the available space
allocated by the framework, set its `style.width` and `style.height` properties
to `'100%'`:

```dart
ui.platformViewRegistry.registerViewFactory(viewType, (int viewId) {
  final html.Element htmlElement = html.DivElement()
    // ..other props
    ..style.width = '100%'
    ..style.height = '100%';
  // ...
  return htmlElement;
});
```

If other techniques are used to lay out the platform view (like `inset: 0`) a
value of `auto` for `width` and `height` is enough to stop the warning.

Read more about [`CSS width`][] and [`CSS height`][].

### Tests

After this change, user's test code does **not** need to deeply inspect the
contents of the shadow root of the App. All of the platform view contents will
be placed as direct children of `flt-glass-pane`, wrapped in a
`flt-platform-view` element.

Avoid looking inside the `flt-glass-pane` shadow root, it is considered a
**"private implementation detail"**, and its markup can change at any time,
without notice.
