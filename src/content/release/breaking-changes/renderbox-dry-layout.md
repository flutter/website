## Summary

A new method named `computeDryLayout` was added to the `RenderBox` protocol.
Subclasses of `RenderBox` are expected to implement it to correctly report
their desired size given a set of `BoxConstraints` during intrinsic
calculations. Subclasses that implement `computeDryLayout` no longer need to
override `performResize`.

## Context

A new method, `computeDryLayout`, was added to the `RenderBox` protocol to
correctly calculate the intrinsic sizes of a `RenderParagraph` with `WidgetSpan`
children and a `RenderWrap`. The method receives a set of `BoxConstraints` and
is expected to calculate the resulting size of the `RenderBox` without changing
any internal state. It's essentially a dry run of `performLayout` that only
calculates the resulting size and doesn't place the children. The
`computeDryLayout` method is part of the intrinsics protocol (see also
[`RenderBox.computeMinIntrinsicWidth`][] and friends).

## Description of change

Subclasses of `RenderBox` need to override the new `computeDryLayout` method
if they are used as a descendant of a `RenderObject` that may query the intrinsic
size of its children. Examples of widgets that do this are `IntrinsicHeight`
and `IntrinsicWidth`.

The default implementation of `RenderBox.performResize` also uses the size
computed by `computeDryLayout` to perform the resize. Overriding `performResize`
is therefore no longer necessary.

## Migration guide

Subclasses that already override `performResize` can be migrated by simply
changing the function signature from `void performResize()` to
`Size computeDryLayout(BoxConstraints constraints)` and by returning the
calculated size instead of assigning it to the `size` setter. The old
implementation of `performResize` can be removed.

Code before migration:

```dart
  @override
  void performResize() {
     size = constraints.biggest;
  }
```

Code after migration:

```dart
  // This replaces the old performResize method.
  @override
  Size computeDryLayout(BoxConstraints constraints) {
     return constraints.biggest;
  }
```

If the subclass doesn't override `performResize`, the implementation of
`computeDryLayout` has to be extracted from the `performLayout` method.
Basically, `computeDryLayout` needs to do all the work `performLayout` is doing
to figure out the size of the `RenderBox`. However, instead of assigning it
to the `size` setter, it returns the computed size. If `computeDryLayout`
needs to know the size of its children, it must obtain that size by calling
`getDryLayout` on the child instead of calling `layout`.

If for some reason it is impossible to calculate the dry layout, `computeDryLayout`
must call `debugCannotComputeDryLayout` from within an assert and return a dummy
size of `const Size(0, 0)`. Calculating a dry layout is, for example, impossible
if the size of a `RenderBox` depends on the baseline metrics of its children.

```dart
  @override
  Size computeDryLayout(BoxConstraints constraints) {
    assert(debugCannotComputeDryLayout(
      reason: 'Layout requires baseline metrics, which are only available after a full layout.'
    ));
    return const Size(0, 0);
  }
```
