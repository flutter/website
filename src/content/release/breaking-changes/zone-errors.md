title: "\"Zone mismatch\" message"
description: >
  When Flutter's bindings are initialized in a different zone
  than the Zone used for `runApp`, a warning is printed to the console.
---

## Summary

Starting with Flutter 3.10, the framework detects mismatches
when using Zones and reports them to the console in debug builds.

## Background

Zones are a mechanism for managing callbacks in Dart.
While primarily useful for overriding `print` and `Timer` logic in tests,
and for catching errors in tests,
they are sometimes used for scoping global variables
to certain parts of an application.

Flutter requires (and has always required)
that all framework code be run in the same zone.
Notably, this means that calls to
`WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` should be run in the same zone
as calls to `runApp()`.

Historically, Flutter has not detected such mismatches.
This sometimes leads to obscure and hard-to-debug issues.
For example,
a callback for keyboard input might be invoked
using a zone that does not have access to the `zoneValues` that it expects.
In our experience,
most if not all code that uses Zones
in a way that does not guarantee that all parts of
the Flutter framework are working in the same Zone
has some latent bug.
Often these bugs appear unrelated to the use of Zones.

To help developers who have accidentally violated this invariant,
starting with Flutter 3.10,
a non-fatal warning is printed in debug builds when a mismatch is detected.
The warning looks like the following:

```plaintext
════════ Exception caught by Flutter framework ════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown during runApp:
Zone mismatch.

The Flutter bindings were initialized in a different zone than is now being used.
This will likely cause confusion and bugs as any zone-specific configuration will
inconsistently use the configuration of the original binding initialization zone or
this zone based on hard-to-predict factors such as which zone was active when a
particular callback was set.
It is important to use the same zone when calling `ensureInitialized` on the
binding as when calling `runApp` later.
To make this warning fatal, set BindingBase.debugZoneErrorsAreFatal to true before
the bindings are initialized (i.e. as the first statement in `void main() { }`).
[...]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

The warning can be made fatal by
setting [`BindingBase.debugZoneErrorsAreFatal`][] to `true`.
This flag might be changed to default to `true` in a future version of Flutter.

## Migration guide

The best way to silence this message is to
remove use of Zones from within the application.
Zones can be very hard to debug,
because they are essentially global variables,
and break encapsulation.
Best practice is to avoid global variables and zones.

If removing zones is not an option
(for example because the application depends on a third-party library
that relies on zones for its configuration),
then the various calls into the Flutter framework
should be moved to all be in the same zone.
Typically, this means moving the call to
`WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` to the
same closure as the call to `runApp()`.

This can be awkward when the zone in which `runApp` is run
is being initialized with `zoneValues` obtained from a plugin
(which requires `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`
to have been called).

One option in this kind of scenario is to
place a mutable object in the `zoneValues`, and
update that object with the value once the value is available.

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class Mutable<T> {
  Mutable(this.value);
  T value;
}

void main() {
  var myValue = Mutable<double>(0.0);
  Zone.current.fork(
    zoneValues: {
      'myKey': myValue,
    }
  ).run(() {
    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    var newValue = ...; // obtain value from plugin
    myValue.value = newValue; // update value in Zone
    runApp(...);
  });
}
```

In code that needs to use `myKey`,
it can be obtained indirectly using `Zone.current['myKey'].value`.

When such a solution does not work
because a third-party dependency requires the use
of a specific type for a specific `zoneValues` key,
all calls into the dependency can be
wrapped in `Zone` calls that provide suitable values.

It is strongly recommended that packages that use zones in this way
migrate to more maintainable solutions.
