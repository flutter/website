title: Transition of platform channel test interfaces to flutter_test package
description: >
   The setMockMessageHandler method related APIs have
   moved from package:flutter to package:flutter_test
---

{% render docs/breaking-changes.md %}

## Summary

The following methods have been replaced by APIs
in the `flutter_test` package:

* `BinaryMessenger.checkMessageHandler`
* `BinaryMessenger.setMockMessageHandler`
* `BinaryMessenger.checkMockMessageHandler`
* `BasicMessageChannel.setMockMessageHandler`
* `MethodChannel.checkMethodCallHandler`
* `MethodChannel.setMockMethodCallHandler`
* `MethodChannel.checkMockMethodCallHandler`

The `onPlatformMessage` callback is no longer used
by the Flutter framework.

## Context

As part of a refactoring of the low-level plugin
communications architecture, we have moved from the
previous `onPlatformMessage`/`handlePlatformMessage`
logic to a per-channel buffering system implemented in
the engine in the `ChannelBuffers` class.
To maintain compatibility with existing code,
the existing `BinaryMessenger.setMessageHandler` API
has been refactored to use the new `ChannelBuffers` API.

One difference between the `ChannelBuffers` API and the
previous API is that the new API is more consistent in
its approach to asynchrony. As a side-effect,
the APIs around message passing are now entirely asynchronous.

This posed a problem for the implementation of the legacy
testing APIs which, for historical reasons,
were previously in the `flutter` package.
Since they relied on the underlying logic being partly synchronous,
they required refactoring.
To avoid adding even more test logic into the `flutter` package,
a decision was made to move this logic to the `flutter_test` package.

## Description of change

Specifically, the following APIs were affected:

* `BinaryMessenger.checkMessageHandler`: Obsolete.
* `BinaryMessenger.setMockMessageHandler`: Replaced by
  `TestDefaultBinaryMessenger.setMockMessageHandler`.
* `BinaryMessenger.checkMockMessageHandler`: Replaced
   by `TestDefaultBinaryMessenger.checkMockMessageHandler`.
* `BasicMessageChannel.setMockMessageHandler`: Replaced
   by `TestDefaultBinaryMessenger.setMockDecodedMessageHandler`.
* `MethodChannel.checkMethodCallHandler`: Obsolete.
* `MethodChannel.setMockMethodCallHandler`: Replaced by
   `TestDefaultBinaryMessenger.setMockMethodCallHandler`.
* `MethodChannel.checkMockMethodCallHandler`: Replaced
   by `TestDefaultBinaryMessenger.checkMockMessageHandler`.

These replacements are only available to code using the
new `TestDefaultBinaryMessengerBinding`
(such as any code using `testWidgets` in a `flutter_test` test).
There is no replacement for production code that was using
these APIs, as they were not intended for production code use.

Tests using `checkMessageHandler` have no equivalent in the
new API, since message handler registration is handled
directly by the `ChannelBuffers` object, which does not
expose the currently registered listener for a channel.
(Tests verifying handler registration appear to be rare.)

Code that needs migrating may see errors such as the following:

```plaintext
  error - The method 'setMockMessageHandler' isn't defined for the type 'BinaryMessenger' at test/sensors_test.dart:64:8 - (undefined_method)

  error • The method 'setMockMethodCallHandler' isn't defined for the type 'MethodChannel' • test/widgets/editable_text_test.dart:5623:30 • undefined_method

[error] The method 'setMockMessageHandler' isn't defined for the type 'BasicMessageChannel' (test/material/feedback_test.dart:37:36)
```

In addition, the `onPlatformMessage` callback,
which previously was hooked by the framework to
receive messages from plugins, is no longer used
(and will be removed in due course). As a result,
calling this callback to inject messages into the
framework no longer has an effect.

## Migration guide

The `flutter_test` package provides some shims so that
uses of the obsolete `setMock...` and `checkMock...`
methods will continue to work.
Tests that previously did not import
`package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart` can
do so to enable these shims;
this should be sufficient to migrate most code.

These shim APIs are deprecated, however. Instead,
in code using `WidgetTester` (for example, using `testWidgets`),
it is recommended to use the following patterns to
replace calls to those methods
(where `tester` is the `WidgetTester` instance):

```dart
// old code
ServicesBinding.defaultBinaryMessenger.setMockMessageHandler(...);
ServicesBinding.defaultBinaryMessenger.checkMockMessageHandler(...);
// new code
tester.binding.defaultBinaryMessenger.setMockMessageHandler(...);
tester.binding.defaultBinaryMessenger.checkMockMessageHandler(...);
```

```dart
// old code
myChannel.setMockMessageHandler(...);
myChannel.checkMockMessageHandler(...);
// new code
tester.binding.defaultBinaryMessenger.setMockDecodedMessageHandler(myChannel, ...);
tester.binding.defaultBinaryMessenger.checkMockMessageHandler(myChannel, ...);
```

```dart
// old code
myMethodChannel.setMockMethodCallHandler(...);
myMethodChannel.checkMockMethodCallHandler(...);
// new code
tester.binding.defaultBinaryMessenger.setMockMethodCallHandler(myMethodChannel, ...);
tester.binding.defaultBinaryMessenger.checkMockMessageHandler(myMethodChannel, ...);
```

Tests that use `package:test` and `test()`
can be changed to use `package:flutter_test` and `testWidgets()`
to get access to a `WidgetTester`.

Code that does not have access to a `WidgetTester` can refer to
`TestDefaultBinaryMessengerBinding.instance!.defaultBinaryMessenger`
instead of `tester.binding.defaultBinaryMessenger`.

Tests that do not use the default test widgets binding
(`AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding`,
which is initialized by `testWidgets`) can mix the
`TestDefaultBinaryMessengerBinding` mixin into their
binding to get the same results.

Tests that manipulate `onPlatformMessage` will no longer
function as designed. To send mock messages to the framework,
consider using `ChannelBuffers.push`.
There is no mechanism to intercept messages from the plugins
and forward them to the framework in the new API.
If your use case requires such a mechanism, please file a bug.
