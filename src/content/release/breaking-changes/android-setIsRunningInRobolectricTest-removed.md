title: FlutterMain.setIsRunningInRobolectricTest on Android removed
description: >
    The test-only FlutterMain.setIsRunningInRobolectricTest API on the 
    Android engine is consolidated into the FlutterInjector.

## Summary

If you write Java JUnit tests (such as Robolectric tests)
against the Flutter engine's Java embedding and used the
`FlutterMain.setIsRunningInRobolectricTest(true)` API,
replace it with the following:

```java
FlutterJNI mockFlutterJNI = mock(FlutterJNI.class);
FlutterInjector.setInstance(
        new FlutterInjector.Builder()
            .setFlutterLoader(new FlutterLoader(mockFlutterJNI))
            .build());
```

This should be very uncommon.

## Context

The `FlutterMain` class itself is being deprecated and replaced with the
`FlutterInjector` class. The `FlutterMain` class uses a number of
static variables and functions than make it difficult to test.
`FlutterMain.setIsRunningInRobolectricTest()` is one ad-hoc static
mechanism to allow tests to run on the host machine on JVM without
loading the `libflutter.so` native library
(which can't be done on the host machine).

Rather than one-off solutions, all dependency injections needed for tests
in Flutter's Android/Java engine embedding are now moved to the
[`FlutterInjector`] class.

[`FlutterInjector`]: https://cs.opensource.google/flutter/engine/+/master:shell/platform/android/io/flutter/FlutterInjector.java

Within the `FlutterInjector` class,
the `setFlutterLoader()` Builder
function allows for control of how the
[`FlutterLoader`][] class locates and loads
the `libflutter.so` library.

[`FlutterLoader`]: https://cs.opensource.google/flutter/engine/+/master:shell/platform/android/io/flutter/embedding/engine/loader/FlutterLoader.java

## Description of change

This [engine commit][] removed the
`FlutterMain.setIsRunningInRobolectricTest()` testing function;
and the following [commit][] added a 
`FlutterInjector` class to assist testing.
[PR 20473][] further refactored `FlutterLoader`
and `FlutterJNI` to allow for additional mocking and testing.

[PR 20473]: {{site.repo.engine}}/pull/20473
to allow for additional mocking/testing.

## Migration guide

Code before migration:

```java
FlutterMain.setIsRunningInRobolectricTest(true);
```

Code after migration:

```java
FlutterJNI mockFlutterJNI = mock(FlutterJNI.class);
FlutterInjector.setInstance(
        new FlutterInjector.Builder()
            .setFlutterLoader(new FlutterLoader(mockFlutterJNI))
            .build());
```

## Timeline

Landed in version: 1.22.0-2.0.pre.133<br>
In stable release: 2.0.0
