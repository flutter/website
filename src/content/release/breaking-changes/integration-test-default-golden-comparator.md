title: Integration test default golden-file comparators changed on Android and iOS.
description: >-
  When using `package:integration_test` to run a test _on_ an Android device or
  emualtor, or an iOS device or simulator, the default `goldenFileComparator`
  has changed, and correctly uses the host filesystem.
---

## Summary

Unless a user-defined [`goldenFileComparator`][] is set, either manually in a
test, or using a `flutter_test_config.dart` file, Android and iOS devices
and emulators/simulators have a new default that proxies to the local host
filesystem, fixing a long-standing bug ([#143299][Issue 143299]).

## Background

The package [`integration_test`][], and its integration with [`flutter_test`][]
has historically had a bug where using [`matchesGoldenFile`][] or similar APIs
where a `FileSystemException` was thrown.

Some users may have worked around this issue by writing and using a custom
[`goldenFileComparator`][]:

```dart
import 'package:integration_test/integration_test.dart';
import 'package:my_integration_test/custom_golden_file_comparator.dart';

void main() {
  goldenFileComparator = CustomGoldenFileComparatorThatWorks();

  // ...
}
```

Such workarounds are no longer necessary, and if type checking the default,
will no longer work as before:

```dart
if (goldenFileComparator is ...) {
  // The new default is a new (hidden) type that has not existed before.
}
```

## Migration Guide

In most cases, we expect users to have to do nothing - this will be in a sense
_new_ functionality that replaced functionality that did not work and caused
an unhandled exception which would fail a test.

In cases where users wrote custom test infrastructure and compartors, consider
instead removing the [`goldenFileComparator`][] overrides, and instead rely on
the (new) default which should work as expected:

```diff
import 'package:integration_test/integration_test.dart';
-import 'package:my_integration_test/custom_golden_file_comparator.dart';

void main() {
-  goldenFileComparator = CustomGoldenFileComparatorThatWorks();

  // ...
}
```

_Fun fact_: The existing code that was used for the _web_ platform was [reused][PR 160484].
