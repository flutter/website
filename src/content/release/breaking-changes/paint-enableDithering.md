## Summary

[`Paint.enableDithering`][] is now `true` by default (previously, `false`),
and is _deprecated_ pending removal - Flutter no longer supports
user-configurable dithering settings.

In addition, the dithering documentation states support is _only_ for gradients.

## Background

[`Paint.enableDithering`][] was added as a global option in [PR 13868][] as
a response to [Issue 44134][], which reported that gradients in Flutter had
visible banding artifacts:

> Gradients currently have a lot of color banding on all devices, and it looks
> very weird when using the pulse animation too. A solution is to make the
> gradients opaque, and to use dithered gradients with Skia. Dithered gradients
> aren't currently exposed, so adding a dither parameter to dart:ui's Paint
> class would be nice. We'd be able to manually draw our gradients with a
> CustomPainter.

![Example of banding](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30870216/210907719-4f4a1a8d-e28a-4d39-9e99-3635a26a0c74.png)

[Issue 118073][] reported that gradients in our new [Impeller][]
backend displayed visible banding artifacts in some gradients.
It was later discovered that Impeller didn't support the (rarely used)
[`Paint.enableDithering`][] property.

After adding dithering support to Impeller ([PR 44181][], [PR 44331][],
[PR 44522][]), and reviewing the performance impact of dithering (negligible),
the following observations were made:

1. Consensus that gradients look good by default: [Issue 112498][].
1. Having a global option was intended to be deprecated: [PR 13868][].

This resulted in the following decisions:

1. Make dithering enabled by default.
1. Deprecate the global option.
1. Remove the global option in a future release.

As part of that process, the ability for dithering to affect anything
other than gradients was removed in [PR 44730][] and [PR 44912][].
That was done to ease the process of migrating, because
Impeller will never support dithering for anything but gradients.

## Migration guide

Most users and libraries will not need to make any changes.

For users that maintain golden tests, you might
need to update your golden images to reflect the new default.
For example, if you use [`matchesGoldenFile`][] to
test a widget that contains a gradient:

```console
$ flutter test --update-goldens
```

While this is not expected to be a common case, you can
disable dithering temporarily by setting the `enableDithering` property in
your `main()` method (either in an app or test):

```dart diff
  void main() {
+   // TODO: Remove this after XYZ.
+   Paint.enableDithering = false;

    runApp(MyApp());
  }
```

As the plan is to _permanently_ remove the `enableDithering` property, please
provide feedback in [Issue 112498][] if you have a use case that requires
disabling dithering (due to performance, crashes).

If for some reason you _must_ draw gradients without dithering, you'll need to
write your own custom shader. Describing that is out of the scope of this
migration guide, but you can find some resources and examples:

- [Writing and using fragment shaders][]
- [`hsl_linear_gradient.frag`][]

**NOTE**: Flutter web does not support dithering: [Issue 134250][].
