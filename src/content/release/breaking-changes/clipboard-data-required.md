## Summary

The [`ClipboardData constructor`][]'s `text` argument is no longer nullable.
Code that provides `null` to the `text` argument must be migrated to provide
an empty string `''`.

## Context

In preparation for supporting multiple clipboard data variants, the
`ClipboardData` constructor now requires that at least one data variant is
provided.

Previously, platforms were inconsistent in how they handled `null`.
The behavior is now consistent across platforms. If you are interested
in the low-level details, see [PR 122446][].

## Description of change

The [`ClipboardData constructor`][]'s `text` argument is no longer nullable.

## Migration guide

To reset the text clipboard, use an empty string `''` instead of `null`.

Code before migration:

```dart
void resetClipboard() {
  Clipboard.setData(ClipboardData(text: null));
}
```

Code after migration:

```dart
void resetClipboard() {
  Clipboard.setData(ClipboardData(text: ''));
}
```

## Timeline
