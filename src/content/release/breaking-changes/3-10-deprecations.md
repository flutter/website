description: >
  After reaching end of life, the following deprecated APIs
  were removed from Flutter.

## Summary

In accordance with Flutter's [Deprecation Policy][],
deprecated APIs that reached end of life after the
3.10 stable release have been removed.

All affected APIs have been compiled into this
primary source to aid in migration. A
[quick reference sheet][] is available as well.

[Deprecation Policy]: {{site.repo.flutter}}/blob/main/docs/contributing/Tree-hygiene.md#deprecations
[quick reference sheet]: /go/deprecations-removed-after-3-10

## Changes

This section lists the deprecations, listed by the package and affected class.

### ThemeData.fixTextFieldOutlineLabel

Package: flutter
Supported by Flutter Fix: yes

`ThemeData.fixTextFieldOutlineLabel` was deprecated in v2.5.
References to this property can be removed.

The `fixTextFieldOutlineLabel` was a temporary migration flag that allowed users
to gracefully migrate to a new behavior rather than experiencing a hard break.
Before deprecating, this property was transitioned to the new default from the
fix to the label for text fields.

**Migration guide**

Code before migration:

```dart
var themeData = ThemeData(
  fixTextFieldOutlineLabel: true,  
);
```

Code after migration:

```dart
var themeData = ThemeData(
);
```

### OverscrollIndicatorNotification.disallowGlow

Package: flutter
Supported by Flutter Fix: yes

`OverscrollIndicatorNotification.disallowGlow` was deprecated in v2.5.
The replacement is the `disallowIndicator` method.

The `disallowIndicator` was created as a replacement for the original method
with the introduction of the `StretchingOverscrollIndicator`. Previously,
the `GlowingOverscrollIndicator` was the only kind to dispatch
`OverscrollIndicatorNotification`s, and so the method was updated to better
reflect multiple kinds of indicators.

**Migration guide**

Code before migration:

```dart
bool _handleOverscrollIndicatorNotification(OverscrollIndicatorNotification notification) {
  notification.disallowGlow();
  return false;
}
```

Code after migration:

```dart
bool _handleOverscrollIndicatorNotification(OverscrollIndicatorNotification notification) {
  notification.disallowIndicator();
  return false;
}
```

### ColorScheme primaryVariant & secondaryVariant

Package: flutter
Supported by Flutter Fix: yes

`ColorScheme.primaryVariant` and `ColorScheme.secondaryVariant` were deprecated
in v2.6. The replacements are the `ColorScheme.primaryContainer` and
`ColorScheme.secondaryContainer`, respectively.

These changes were made to align with the updated Material Design specification
for `ColorScheme`. The updates to `ColorScheme` are covered more extensively in 
the [ColorScheme for Material 3][] design document.

**Migration guide**

Code before migration:

```dart
var colorScheme = ColorScheme(
  primaryVariant: Colors.blue,
  secondaryVariant: Colors.amber,
);
var primaryColor = colorScheme.primaryVariant;
var secondaryColor = colorScheme.secondaryVariant;
```

Code after migration:

```dart
var colorScheme = ColorScheme(
  primaryContainer: Colors.blue,
  secondaryContainer: Colors.amber,
);
var primaryColor = colorScheme.primaryContainer;
var secondaryColor = colorScheme.secondaryContainer;
```

### ThemeData.primaryColorBrightness

Package: flutter
Supported by Flutter Fix: yes

`ThemeData.primaryColorBrightness` was deprecated in v2.6, and has not been used
by the framework since then. References should be removed. The `Brightness` is
now extrapolated from the `ThemeData.primaryColor` if `ThemeData.brightness` has
not been explicitly provided.

This change was made as part of the update to `Theme` to match new Material
Design guidelines. The overall update to the theming system, including the
removal of `primaryColorBrightness` is discussed more extensively in the
[Material Theme System Updates][] design document.

**Migration guide**

Code before migration:

```dart
var themeData = ThemeData(
  primaryColorBrightness: Brightness.dark,
);
```

Code after migration:

```dart
var themeData = ThemeData(
);
```

### RawScrollbar & subclasses updates

Package: flutter
Supported by Flutter Fix: yes

The `isAlwaysShown` property of `RawScrollbar`, `Scrollbar`,
`ScrollbarThemeData` and `CupertinoScrollbar` was deprecated in v2.9. The
replacement in all cases is `thumbVisibility`.

This change was made since `isAlwaysShown` always referred to the scrollbar
thumb. With the addition of a scrollbar track, and varying configurations for
its visibility in response to mouse hovering and dragging, we renamed this
property for a clearer API.

Additionally, `Scrollbar.hoverThickness` was also deprecated in v2.9. Its
replacement is the `MaterialStateProperty` `ScrollbarThemeData.thickness`.

This change was made to allow the thickness of a `Scrollbar` to respond to all
kind of states, including and beyond just hovering. The use of
`MaterialStateProperties` also matches the convention in the material library of
configuring widgets based on their state, rather than enumerating properties for
every permutation of interactive states.

**Migration guide**

Code before migration:

```dart
var rawScrollbar = RawScrollbar(
  isAlwaysShown: true,
);
var scrollbar = Scrollbar(
  isAlwaysShown: true,
  hoverThickness: 15.0,
);
var cupertinoScrollbar = CupertinoScrollbar(
  isAlwaysShown: true,
);
var scrollbarThemeData = ScrollbarThemeData(
  isAlwaysShown: true,
);
```

Code after migration:

```dart
var rawScrollbar = RawScrollbar(
  thumbVisibility: true,
);
var scrollbar = Scrollbar(
  thumbVisibility: true,
);
var cupertinoScrollbar = CupertinoScrollbar(
  thumbVisibility: true,
);
var scrollbarThemeData = ScrollbarThemeData(
  thumbVisibility: true,
  thickness: MaterialStateProperty.resolveWith((Set<MaterialState> states) {
    return states.contains(MaterialState.hovered) ? null : 15.0;
  }),
);
```

### AnimationSheetBuilder display & sheetSize

Package: flutter_test
Supported by Flutter Fix: yes

The `display` and `sheetSize` methods of `AnimationSheetBuilder` were deprecated
in v2.3. The replacement is the `collate` method.

`AnimationSheetBuilder`'s output step previously required these two methods to
be called, but is now streamlined through a single call to `collate`.

The `collate` function directly puts the images together and asynchronously
returns an image. It requires less boilerplate, and outputs smaller images
without any compromise to quality.

**Migration guide**

[In-depth migration guide available]

Code before migration:

```dart
final AnimationSheetBuilder animationSheet = AnimationSheetBuilder(
    frameSize: const Size(40, 40)
);

await tester.pumpFrames(animationSheet.record(
  const Directionality(
    textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
    child: Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(4),
      child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
    ),
  ),
), const Duration(seconds: 2));

tester.binding.setSurfaceSize(animationSheet.sheetSize());

final Widget display = await animationSheet.display();
await tester.pumpWidget(display);

await expectLater(
  find.byWidget(display),
  matchesGoldenFile('material.circular_progress_indicator.indeterminate.png'),
);
```

Code after migration:

```dart
final AnimationSheetBuilder animationSheet = AnimationSheetBuilder(
    frameSize: const Size(40, 40)
);

await tester.pumpFrames(animationSheet.record(
  const Directionality(
    textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,
    child: Padding(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(4),
      child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
    ),
  ),
), const Duration(seconds: 2));

await expectLater(
  animationSheet.collate(20),
  matchesGoldenFile('material.circular_progress_indicator.indeterminate.png'),
);
```

### flutter_test timeout logic

Package: flutter_test
Supported by Flutter Fix: no

The following APIs related to timeout logic in tests were deprecated
in v2.6. There are no replacements, and references should be removed, except for
the `initialTimeout` parameter of `testWidgets`, which is replaced by using
`timeout`.

* `TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.addTime`
* `TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.runAsync` method - `additionalTime` parameter
* `TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.runTest` method - `timeout` parameter
* `AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.runTest` method - `timeout` parameter
* `LiveTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.runTest` method - `timeout` parameter
* `testWidgets` method - `initialTime` parameter

These were found to cause flakiness in testing, and were not in use by tested
customers.

Since being deprecated, use of these parameters have had no effect on tests, so
removing references should have no effect on existing code bases.

**Migration guide**


Code before migration:

```dart
testWidgets('Test', (_) {}, initialTimeout:  Duration(seconds: 5));
```

Code after migration:

```dart
testWidgets('Test', (_) {}, timeout:  Timeout(Duration(seconds: 5)));
```
