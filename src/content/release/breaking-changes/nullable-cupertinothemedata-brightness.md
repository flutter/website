## Summary

[`CupertinoThemeData.brightness`] is now nullable.

## Context

[`CupertinoThemeData.brightness`][] is now used to
override `MediaQuery.platformBrightness` for Cupertino widgets.
Before this change, the [`CupertinoThemeData.brightness`][]
getter returned `Brightness.light` when it was set to null.

## Description of change

Previously [`CupertinoThemeData.brightness`][]
was implemented as a getter:

```dart
Brightness get brightness => _brightness ?? Brightness.light;
final Brightness _brightness;
```

It is now a stored property:

```dart
final Brightness brightness;
```

## Migration guide

Generally [`CupertinoThemeData.brightness`][]
is rarely useful outside of the Flutter framework.
To retrieve the brightness for Cupertino widgets,
now use [`CupertinoTheme.brightnessOf`][] instead.

With this change, it is now possible to override
`CupertinoThemeData.brightness` in a `CupertinoThemeData`
subclass to change the brightness override. For example:

```dart
class AlwaysDarkCupertinoThemeData extends CupertinoThemeData {
  Brightness brightness => Brightness.dark;
}
```

When a `CupertinoTheme` uses the above `CupertinoThemeData`,
dark mode is enabled for all its Cupertino descendants
that are affected by this `CupertinoTheme`.
