title: TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.clock change
description: The Clock implementation now comes from package:clock.
---

{% render docs/docs/breaking-changes.md %}

## Summary

The `TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.clock` now comes from
`package:clock` and not `package:quiver`.

## Context

The `flutter_test` package is removing its dependency on
the heavier weight `quiver` package in favor of a dependency
on two more targeted and lighter weight packages,
`clock` and `fake_async`.

This can affect user code which grabs the clock from a
`TestWidgetsFlutterBinding` and passes that to an API
that expects a `Clock` from `package:quiver`,
for example some code like this:

```dart
testWidgets('some test', (WidgetTester tester) {
  someApiThatWantsAQuiverClock(tester.binding.clock);
});
```

## Migration guide

The error you might see after this change looks something like this:

```plaintext
Error: The argument type 'Clock/*1*/' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'Clock/*2*/'.
 - 'Clock/*1*/' is from 'package:clock/src/clock.dart' ('<pub-cache>/clock/lib/src/clock.dart').
 - 'Clock/*2*/' is from 'package:quiver/time.dart' ('<pub-cache>/quiver/lib/time.dart').
```

### Option #1: Create a package:quiver Clock from a package:clock Clock

The easiest migration is to create a `package:quiver` clock from the
`package:clock` clock, which can be done by passing the `.now` function
tearoff to the `Clock` constructor:

Code before migration:

```dart
testWidgets('some test', (WidgetTester tester) {
  someApiThatWantsAQuiverClock(tester.binding.clock);
});
```

Code after migration:

```dart
testWidgets('some test', (WidgetTester tester) {
  someApiThatWantsAQuiverClock(Clock(tester.binding.clock.now));
});
```

### Option #2: Change the api to accept a package:clock Clock

If you own the api you are calling,
you may want to change it to accept a `Clock`
from `package:clock`.
This is a judgement call based on how many places are
calling this API with something other than a clock
retrieved from a `TestWidgetsFlutterBinding`.

If you go this route, your call sites that are passing
`tester.binding.clock` won't need to be modified,
but other call sites will.

### Option #3: Change the API to accept a `DateTime function()`

If you only use the `Clock` for its `now` function,
and you control the API, then you can also change it
to accept that function directly instead of a `Clock`.
This makes it easily callable with either type of `Clock`,
by passing a tearoff of the `now` method from either type of clock:

Calling code before migration:

```dart
testWidgets('some test', (WidgetTester tester) {
  someApiThatWantsAQuiverClock(tester.binding.clock);
});
```

Calling code after migration:

```dart
testWidgets('some test', (WidgetTester tester) {
  modifiedApiThatTakesANowFunction(tester.binding.clock.now);
});
```
