## Summary

The `WidgetTester.enterText` and `TestTextInput.enterText` methods
now move the caret to the end of the input text.

## Context

The caret indicates the insertion point within the current text in an
active input field. Typically, when a new character is entered, the
caret stays immediately after it. In Flutter the caret position is
represented by a collapsed selection. When the selection is invalid,
usually the user won't be able to modify or add text until they
change the selection to a valid value.

`WidgetTester.enterText` and `TestTextInput.enterText` are 2 methods
used in tests to replace the content of the target text field. Prior
to this change, `WidgetTester.enterText` and `TestTextInput.enterText`
set the selection to an invalid range (-1, -1), indicating there's
no selection or caret. This contradicts the typical behavior of an
input field.

## Description of change

In addition to replacing the text with the supplied text,
`WidgetTester.enterText` and `TestTextInput.enterText` now set the
selection to `TextSelection.collapsed(offset: text.length)`, instead
of `TextSelection.collapsed(offset: -1)`.

## Migration guide

It should be very uncommon for tests to have to rely on the
previous behavior of `enterText`, since usually the selection
should not be invalid. **Consider changing the expected values of
your tests to adopt the `enterText` change.**

Common test failures this change may introduce includes:

- Golden test failures:

  The caret appears at the end of the text, as opposed to before
  the text prior to the change.

- Different `TextEditingValue.selection` after calling `enterText`:

  The text field's `TextEditingValue` now has a collapsed
  selection with a non-negative offset, as opposed to
  `TextSelection.collapsed(offset: -1)` prior to the change.
  For instance, you may see
  `expect(controller.value.selection.baseOffset, -1);`
  failing after `enterText` calls.

If your tests have to rely on setting the selection to invalid,
the previous behavior can be achieved using`updateEditingValue`:

### `TestTextInput.enterText`

Code before migration:

```dart
await testTextInput.enterText(text);
```

Code after migration:

```dart
await testTextInput.updateEditingValue(TextEditingValue(
  text: text,
));
```

### `WidgetTester.enterText`

Code before migration:

```dart
await tester.enterText(finder, text);
```

Code after migration:

```dart
await tester.showKeyboard(finder);
await tester.updateEditingValue(TextEditingValue(
  text: text,
));
await tester.idle();
```
