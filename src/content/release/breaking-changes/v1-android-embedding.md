## Summary

Android's v1 embedding has been removed in Flutter 3.29.0.
This follows the deprecation described in
[Android v1 embedding app and plugin creation deprecation][].
The following is a full list of classes removed.

```text
io.flutter.app.FlutterActivity
io.flutter.app.FlutterActivityDelegate
io.flutter.app.FlutterActivityEvents
io.flutter.app.FlutterApplication
io.flutter.app.FlutterFragmentActivity
io.flutter.app.FlutterPlayStoreSplitApplication
io.flutter.app.FlutterPluginRegistry

io.flutter.embedding.engine.plugins.shim.ShimPluginRegistry
io.flutter.embedding.engine.plugins.shim.ShimRegistrar

io.flutter.view.FlutterMain
io.flutter.view.FlutterNativeView
io.flutter.view.FlutterView
```

If your project references any of the above classes, consult the following
list for instructions on migration.

* `io.flutter.app.FlutterActivity` was
   replaced with `io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity`.
* `io.flutter.app.FlutterActivityDelegate` was
   replaced with `io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivityAndFragmentDelegate`.
* `io.flutter.app.FlutterActivityEvents` was removed.
* `io.flutter.app.FlutterApplication` was removed.
   Flutter projects with custom `Application` implementations should
   instead extend the base `android.app.Application`.
* `io.flutter.app.FlutterFragmentActivity` was
  replaced with `io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterFragmentActivity`.
* `io.flutter.app.FlutterPlayStoreSplitApplication` was
  replaced with `io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterPlayStoreSplitApplication`.
* `io.flutter.app.FlutterPluginRegistry` was removed,
   as it only served to let plugins support apps using the v1 embedding.
* `io.flutter.embedding.engine.plugins.shim.ShimPluginRegistry` was removed,
   as it only served to support let plugins support apps using the v1 embedding.
* `io.flutter.embedding.engine.plugins.shim.ShimRegistrar` was removed,
   as it only served to support let plugins support apps using the v1 embedding.
* `io.flutter.view.FlutterMain` was
   replaced by `io.flutter.embedding.engine.loader.FlutterLoader`.
* `io.flutter.view.FlutterNativeView` was
   replaced by `io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterView`.
* `io.flutter.view.FlutterView` was
   replaced by `io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterView`.

## Plugin authors

Plugins should remove the `registerWith` method from
their `FlutterPlugin` interface implementation:

```java
public static void registerWith(@NonNull io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry.Registrar registrar);
```

For an example of this migration,
check out the pull request to remove this method from the
Flutter team-owned plugins: [flutter/packages#6494][].
