## Summary

Built executables for Flutter Windows apps are now located in architecture
dependent folders.

## Context

In preparation for supporting Windows on Arm64, the Windows build path was
updated to add the build's target architecture.

Previously, Flutter builds for Windows assumed an x64 target architecture.

## Migration guide

You may need to update your infrastructure to use the new Flutter Windows
build path.

Example build path before the migration:

```plaintext
build\windows\runner\Release\hello_world.exe
```

Example build path after the migration if targeting x64:

```plaintext
build\windows\x64\runner\Release\hello_world.exe
```

Example build path after the migration if targeting Arm64:

```plaintext
build\windows\arm64\runner\Release\hello_world.exe
```

If you use [`package:msix`][], update to version 3.16.7 or newer.
