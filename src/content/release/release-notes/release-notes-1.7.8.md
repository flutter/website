short-title: 1.7.8 release notes
description: Release notes for Flutter 1.7.8.
---

The 1.7.8 release is a follow-on to the 1.5.4 stable release in May,
providing 1289 merged PRs and closing 184 issues.
The major themes of this release are:

*   Support for 32-bit and 64-bit bundles on Android
*   Large number of iOS features and fixes,
    including improved text editing and localization
*   [AndroidX support](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/31028)
    for new projects via the --androidx flag of 'flutter create'
*   A new widget: the
    [RangeSlider](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/RangeSlider-class.html)

As detailed in our
[roadmap](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/roadmap/Roadmap.md),
we're also continuing the ongoing work in the Flutter engine
and framework to support turning on web and desktop targets;
however, this is not yet ready for general usage.


## Support for 32-bit and 64-bit Android Bundles

From August 1st, 2019, Android apps that use native code and target Android 9 Pie will[ be required to provide a 64-bit version](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/01/get-your-apps-ready-for-64-bit.html) in addition to the 32-bit version when publishing to the Google Play Store. Since all Flutter apps include native code, this requirement will affect new Flutter apps submitted to the store, as well as updates to existing Flutter apps. This does not affect existing app versions published to the store.

This release includes support for building app bundles and APKs that support both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries, completing our work on [https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31922](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31922). By using this release when building an Android application, your App Bundle or APK now supports both 32-bit and 64-bit CPU architectures by default.
