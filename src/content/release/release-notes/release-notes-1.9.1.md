shortTitle: 1.9.1 release notes
description: Release notes for Flutter 1.9.1.
---

Hello and welcome to another stable release of Flutter. So far this year, we've been right on target with one stable release each quarter, as per [our plan](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/releases/Flutter-build-release-channels.md) (well, less of a plan and more of a goal, but still, it's been working out pretty well so far…). This release is our biggest yet, with 620 Pull Requests merged from 116 contributors. As always, the interesting PRs are listed below. And there are lots of interesting things to discuss in this release, including:

*   One regression fixed but also one added
*   Some breaking API changes
*   Some severe issues caught and fixed
*   Support for macOS Catalina and iOS 13
*   A number of new features
*   And more!

And to be clear, when I say "we," I mean the Flutter community as a whole. The Flutter team couldn't possibly continue to scale as we have without all of our contributors, no matter who your employer is. Thanks everyone for your contributions!


## Regressions

In this release, we fixed one regression ([37955](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/37955) Update shader warm-up for recent Skia changes) and caused another ([38167](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/38167) Incremental compiler re-issuing of errors from constant evaluator). The new regression is fixed after the 1.9.1 stable release ([00d14e7](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/00d14e7) [CFE] Always start constant evaluation error where we are asked to evaluate), so if you're seeing it, you can choose a more recent build to bring it into your Flutter apps.


## Breaking API Changes

We try hard not to make breaking changes, but we also don't want to create unintuitive APIs as we move Flutter forward to new scenarios and new platforms. These are the breaking changes in this release. Please see the associated announcements so you can move your code forward.

## Severe: Crash, Customer Critical and Performance Fixes

In Flutter, we try to add a little bit of quality to every release. This time around, we fixed several severe issues, including crashes, customer critical issues and performance issues.

## New Features

This release also brings with it two new Material widgets: the ToggleButtons widget (called a [segmented control](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/segmented-controls/) on iOS) and a ColorFilter widget (described below in the Text & Accessibility section). To see these widgets in action, check out short [ToggleButtons ](https://github.com/csells/flutter_toggle_buttons)and [ColorFilter](https://github.com/csells/flutter_color_filter) samples. Also, the SelectableText widget allows the user to select read-only text.

## macOS Catalina Support

With the release of macOS Catalina just around the corner, we've made sure that our tooling continues to work smoothly as you migrate to Catalina, iOS 13 and Xcode 11. I should note that **you'll want to upgrade to the Flutter 1.9.1 stable release before upgrading to Catalina**. The other order works, too, but you'll see an error when you do it that way (the [error](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/33890) is benign, but still…). 

[38325](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/38325) refactor flutter upgrade to be 2 part, with the second part re-entrant

[37445](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/37445) Switch iOS gen_snapshot from multi-arch binary to multiple binaries

[37647](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/37647) Change priority of gen_snapshot search paths


## iOS

With over 50 PRs in this release, iOS support continues to be a big focus for Flutter, including an iOS 13 scrollbar implementation (that includes long-press, drag-from-right and vibration feedback support), an update to the CupertinoSwitch widget to match iOS 13 and continued experimentation with bitcode.

## Android

The biggest addition to Android this release is support for a new flutter command: 'flutter build aar'. This new build command works just like 'flutter build apk' or 'flutter build appbundle', but for plugins and module projects. By building the plugins as [AARs](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library), the Android Gradle plugin can use Jetifier to translate support libraries into AndroidX libraries for all the plugin's native code, which reduces the error rate when using AndroidX in apps.

## Text & Accessibility

The biggest change in text & accessibility for this release is the new ColorFilter support, which enables you to recolor an entire widget tree according, for example, to adjust your app for users with red/green color blindness.
