## If you see warnings about bindings

When migrating to Flutter 3,
you might see warnings like the following:

```plaintext
Warning: Operand of null-aware operation '!' has type 'SchedulerBinding' which excludes null.
```

These are caused by a simplification of the API
(the `instance` property on bindings is now non-nullable),
combined with an eager compiler that wants to report
any case where redundant null-aware operators
(such as `!` and `?.`) that are used when
they're not necessary.

If this happens,
there might be several causes with different solutions:

### Dependencies

If your dependencies use bindings,
they might need updating to silence the warnings.
Your builds should be unaffected except for
the verbose warnings.
You can ignore the warnings for now
(maybe reach out to your dependency's
developers to convince them to update).

### Your code

If the problem refers to your own code,
you can update it by running `dart fix --apply`.
This should resolve all the warnings.

If you need your code to support both
Flutter 3 and earlier versions
(maybe because your code is a library),
then you can wrap calls to `binding.instance`
with calls to a method such as the following:

```dart
/// This allows a value of type T or T?
/// to be treated as a value of type T?.
///
/// We use this so that APIs that have become
/// non-nullable can still be used with `!` and `?`
/// to support older versions of the API as well.
T? _ambiguate<T>(T? value) => value;
```

For example, instead of the following:

```dart
SchedulerBinding.instance!.addPostFrameCallback(...);
```

You can use:

```dart
_ambiguate(SchedulerBinding.instance)!.addPostFrameCallback(...);
```

When you no longer need to support versions of
Flutter before 3.0.0, you can remove this and
replace it with the following:

```dart
SchedulerBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback(...);
```

### Framework issues

If the error messages do not point to one of your dependencies,
and `dart fix --apply` doesn't fix the issue,
or if the warnings are fatal
(for example, your application refuses to run), please
[file a bug]({{site.repo.flutter}}/issues/new/choose).
