description: Learn how to integrate a Flutter module into your existing iOS project.
---

Flutter UI components can be incrementally added into your existing iOS
application as embedded frameworks.
To embed Flutter in your existing application,
consider one of the following three methods.

| Embedding Method | Methodology | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| Use CocoaPods _(Recommended)_ | Install and use the Flutter SDK and CocoaPods. Flutter compiles the `flutter_module` from source each time Xcode builds the iOS app. | Least complicated method to embed Flutter into your app. |
| Use [iOS frameworks][] | Create iOS frameworks for Flutter components, embed them into your iOS, and update your existing app's build settings. | Doesn't require every developer to install the Flutter SDK and CocoaPods on their local machines. |
| Use iOS frameworks and CocoaPods | Embed the frameworks for your iOS app and the plugins in Xcode, but distribute the Flutter engine as a CocoaPods podspec. | Provides an alternative to distributing the large Flutter engine (`Flutter.xcframework`) library. |

When you add Flutter to your existing iOS app,
it [increases the size of your iOS app][app-size].

For examples using an app built with UIKit,
see the iOS directories in the [add_to_app code samples][].
For an example using SwiftUI, consult the iOS directory in [News Feed App][].

## Development system requirements

Your development environment must meet the
[macOS system requirements for Flutter][] with [Xcode installed][].
Flutter supports Xcode {{site.appmin.xcode}} or later and [CocoaPods][] {{site.appmin.cocoapods}} or later.

## Create a Flutter module

To embed Flutter into your existing application with any method,
create a Flutter module first.
Use the following command to create a Flutter module.

```console
$ cd /path/to/my_flutter
$ flutter create --template module my_flutter
```

Flutter creates module project under `/path/to/my_flutter/`.
If you use the [CocoaPods method][], save the module
in the same parent directory as your existing iOS app.

[CocoaPods method]: /add-to-app/ios/project-setup/?tab=embed-using-cocoapods

From the Flutter module directory,
you can run the same `flutter` commands you would in any other Flutter project,
like `flutter run` or `flutter build ios`.
You can also run the module in [VS Code][] or
[Android Studio/IntelliJ][] with the Flutter and Dart plugins.
This project contains a single-view example version of your module
before embeddeding it in your existing iOS app.
This helps when testing the Flutter-only parts of your code.

## Organize your module

The `my_flutter` module directory structure resembles a typical Flutter app.

```plaintext
my_flutter/
├── .ios/
│   ├── Runner.xcworkspace
│   └── Flutter/podhelper.rb
├── lib/
│   └── main.dart
├── test/
└── pubspec.yaml
```

Your Dart code should be added to the `lib/` directory.
Your Flutter dependencies, packages, and plugins must be added to the
`pubspec.yaml` file.

The `.ios/` hidden subfolder contains an Xcode workspace where
you can run a standalone version of your module.
This wrapper project bootstraps your Flutter code.
It contains helper scripts to facilitate building frameworks or
embedding the module into your existing application with CocoaPods.

:::note

* Add custom iOS code to your own existing application's
  project or to a plugin, not to the module's `.ios/`
  directory. Changes made in your module's `.ios/`
  directory don't appear in your existing iOS project
  using the module, and might be overwritten by Flutter.

* Exclude the `.ios/` directory from source control as
  it's autogenerated.

* Before building the module on a new machine,
  run `flutter pub get` in the `my_flutter` directory.
  This regenerates the `.ios/` directory before building
  the iOS project that uses the Flutter module.

## Embed a Flutter module in your iOS app

After you have developed your Flutter module,
you can embed it using the methods described
in the table at the top of the page.

You can run in **Debug** mode on a simulator or a real device,
and **Release** mode on a real device.

## Set local network privacy permissions

On iOS 14 and later, enable the Dart multicast DNS service in the
**Debug** version of your iOS app.
This adds [debugging functionalities such as hot-reload and DevTools][]
using `flutter attach`.

:::warning
Never enable this service in the **Release** version of your app.
The Apple App Store might reject your app.
:::

To set local network privacy permissions only in the Debug version of your app,
create a separate `Info.plist` per build configuration.
SwiftUI projects start without an `Info.plist` file.
If you need to create a property list,
you can do so through Xcode or text editor.
The following instructions assume the default **Debug** and **Release**.
Adjust the names as needed depending on your app's build configurations.

1. Create a new property list.

   1. Open your project in Xcode.

   1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on the project name.

   1. From the **Targets** list in the Editor pane, click on your app.

   1. Click the **Info** tab.

   1. Expand **Custom iOS Target Properties**.

   1. Right-click on the list and select **Add Row**.

   1. From the dropdown menu, select **Bonjour Services**.
      This creates a new property list in the project directory
      called `Info`. This displays as `Info.plist` in the Finder.

1. Rename the `Info.plist` to `Info-Debug.plist`

   1. Click on **Info** file in the project list at the left.

   1. In the **Identity and Type** panel at the right,
      change the **Name** from `Info.plist` to `Info-Debug.plist`.

1. Create a Release property list.

   1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on `Info-Debug.plist`.

   1. Select **File** > **Duplicate...**.  
      You can also press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.

   1. In the dialog box, set the **Save As:** field to
      `Info-Release.plist` and click **Save**.

1. Add the necessary properties to the **Debug** property list.

   1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on `Info-Debug.plist`.

   1. Add the String value `_dartVmService._tcp`
      to the **Bonjour Services** array.

   1. _(Optional)_ To set your desired customized permission dialog text,
      add the key **Privacy - Local Network Usage Description**.

      {% render docs/captioned-image.liquid,
      image:"development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/debug-plist.png",
      caption:"The `Info-Debug` property list with the **Bonjour Services**
      and **Privacy - Local Network Usage Description** keys added" %}

1. Set the target to use different property lists for different build modes.

   1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on your project.

   1. Click the **Build Settings** tab.

   1. Click **All** and **Combined** sub-tabs.

   1. In the Search box, type `plist`.  
      This limits the settings to those that include property lists.

   1. Scroll through the list until you see **Packaging**.

   1. Click on the **Info.plist File** setting.

   1. Change the **Info.plist File** value
      from `path/to/Info.plist` to `path/to/Info-$(CONFIGURATION).plist`.

      {%- render docs/captioned-image.liquid,
      image:"development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/set-plist-build-setting.png",
      caption:"Updating the `Info.plist` build setting to use build
      mode-specific property lists" %}

      This resolves to the path **Info-Debug.plist** in **Debug** and
      **Info-Release.plist** in **Release**.

      {% render docs/captioned-image.liquid,
      image:"development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/plist-build-setting.png",
      caption:"The updated **Info.plist File** build setting displaying the
      configuration variations" %}

1. Remove the **Release** property list from the **Build Phases**.

   1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on your project.

   1. Click the **Build Phases** tab.

   1. Expand **Copy Bundle Resources**.

   1. If this list includes `Info-Release.plist`,
      click on it and then click the **-** (minus sign) under it
      to remove the property list from the resources list.

      {% render docs/captioned-image.liquid,
      image:"development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/copy-bundle.png",
      caption:"The **Copy Bundle** build phase displaying the
      **Info-Release.plist** setting. Remove this setting." %}

1. The first Flutter screen your Debug app loads prompts
   for local network permission.

   Click **OK**.

   _(Optional)_ To grant permission before the app loads, enable
   **Settings > Privacy > Local Network > Your App**.

## Mitigate known issue with Apple Silicon Macs

On [Macs running Apple Silicon][apple-silicon],
the host app builds for an `arm64` simulator.
While Flutter supports `arm64` simulators, some plugins might not.
If you use one of these plugins, you might see a compilation error like
**Undefined symbols for architecture arm64**.
If this occurs,
exclude `arm64` from the simulator architectures in your host app.

1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on your project.

1. Click the **Build Settings** tab.

1. Click **All** and **Combined** sub-tabs.

1. Under **Architectures**, click on **Excluded Architectures**.

1. Expand to see the available build configurations.

1. Click **Debug**.

1. Click the **+** (plus sign).

1. Select **iOS Simulator**.

1. Double-click in the value column for **Any iOS Simulator SDK**.

1. Click the **+** (plus sign).

1. Type `arm64` in the **Debug > Any iOS Simulator SDK** dialog box.

   {% render docs/captioned-image.liquid,
   image:"development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/excluded-archs.png",
   caption:"Add `arm64` as an excluded architecture for your app" %}  

1. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close this dialog box.

1. Repeat these steps for the **Release** build mode.

1. Repeat for any iOS unit test targets.
