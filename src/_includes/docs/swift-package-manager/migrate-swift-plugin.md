Replace `plugin_name` throughout this guide with the name of your plugin.
The example below uses `ios`, replace `ios` with `macos`/`darwin` as applicable.

1. [Turn on the Swift Package Manager feature][enableSPM].

1. Start by creating a directory under the `ios`, `macos`, and/or `darwin`
   directories.
   Name this new directory the name of the platform package.

   <pre>
   plugin_name/ios/
   ├── ...
   └── <b>plugin_name/</b>
   </pre>

1. Within this new directory, create the following files/directories:

   - `Package.swift` (file)
   - `Sources` (directory)
   - `Sources/plugin_name` (directory)

   Your plugin should look like:

   <pre>
   plugin_name/ios/
   ├── ...
   └── plugin_name/
      ├── <b>Package.swift</b>
      └── <b>Sources/plugin_name/</b>
   </pre>

1. Use the following template in the `Package.swift` file:

   ```swift title="Package.swift"
   // swift-tools-version: 5.9
   // The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.
   
   import PackageDescription
   
   let package = Package(
       // TODO: Update your plugin name.
       name: "plugin_name",
       platforms: [
           // TODO: Update the platforms your plugin supports.
           // If your plugin only supports iOS, remove `.macOS(...)`.
           // If your plugin only supports macOS, remove `.iOS(...)`.
           .iOS("12.0"),
           .macOS("10.14")
       ],
       products: [
           // TODO: Update your library and target names.
           // If the plugin name contains "_", replace with "-" for the library name.
           .library(name: "plugin-name", targets: ["plugin_name"])
       ],
       dependencies: [],
       targets: [
           .target(
               // TODO: Update your target name.
               name: "plugin_name",
               dependencies: [],
               resources: [
                   // TODO: If your plugin requires a privacy manifest
                   // (e.g. if it uses any required reason APIs), update the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file
                   // to describe your plugin's privacy impact, and then uncomment this line.
                   // For more information, see:
                   // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files
                   // .process("PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy"),
   
                   // TODO: If you have other resources that need to be bundled with your plugin, refer to
                   // the following instructions to add them:
                   // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package
               ]
           )
       ]
   )
   ```

1. Update the [supported platforms][] in your `Package.swift` file.

   ```swift title="Package.swift"
       platforms: [
           // TODO: Update the platforms your plugin supports.
           // If your plugin only supports iOS, remove `.macOS(...)`.
           // If your plugin only supports macOS, remove `.iOS(...)`.
           [!.iOS("12.0"),!]
           [!.macOS("10.14")!]
       ],
   ```

   [supported platforms]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription/supportedplatform

1. Update the package, library, and target names in your `Package.swift` file.

   ```swift title="Package.swift"
   let package = Package(
       // TODO: Update your plugin name.
       name: [!"plugin_name"!],
       platforms: [
           .iOS("12.0"),
           .macOS("10.14")
       ],
       products: [
           // TODO: Update your library and target names.
           // If the plugin name contains "_", replace with "-" for the library name
           .library(name: [!"plugin-name"!], targets: [[!"plugin_name"!]])
       ],
       dependencies: [],
       targets: [
           .target(
               // TODO: Update your target name.
               name: [!"plugin_name"!],
               dependencies: [],
               resources: [
                   // TODO: If your plugin requires a privacy manifest
                   // (e.g. if it uses any required reason APIs), update the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file
                   // to describe your plugin's privacy impact, and then uncomment this line.
                   // For more information, see:
                   // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files
                   // .process("PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy"),
   
                   // TODO: If you have other resources that need to be bundled with your plugin, refer to
                   // the following instructions to add them:
                   // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package
               ]
           )
       ]
   )
   ```

   :::note
   If the plugin name contains `_`, the library name must be a `-` separated
   version of the plugin name.
   :::

1. If your plugin has a [`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file][], move it to
   `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` and uncomment
   the resource in the `Package.swift` file.

   ```swift title="Package.swift"
               resources: [
                   // TODO: If your plugin requires a privacy manifest
                   // (e.g. if it uses any required reason APIs), update the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file
                   // to describe your plugin's privacy impact, and then uncomment this line.
                   // For more information, see:
                   // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files
                   [!.process("PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy"),!]
   
                   // TODO: If you have other resources that need to be bundled with your plugin, refer to
                   // the following instructions to add them:
                   // https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package
               ],
   ```

1. Move any resource files from `ios/Assets` to
   `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name` (or a subdirectory).
   Add the resource files to your `Package.swift` file, if applicable.
   For more instructions, see
   [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/bundling-resources-with-a-swift-package).

1. Move all files from `ios/Classes` to `ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name`.

1. The `ios/Assets`, `ios/Resources`, and `ios/Classes` directories should now
   be empty and can be deleted.

1. If your plugin uses [Pigeon][], update your Pigeon input file.

   ```dart title="pigeons/messages.dart" diff
     kotlinOptions: KotlinOptions(),
     javaOut: 'android/app/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/Messages.java',
     javaOptions: JavaOptions(),
   - swiftOut: 'ios/Classes/messages.g.swift',
   + swiftOut: 'ios/plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/messages.g.swift',
     swiftOptions: SwiftOptions(),
   ```

1. Update your `Package.swift` file with any customizations you might need.

   1. Open the `ios/plugin_name/` directory in Xcode.

   1. In Xcode, open your `Package.swift` file.
      Verify Xcode doesn't produce any warnings or errors for this file.

      :::tip
      If Xcode doesn't show any files, quit Xcode (**Xcode > Quit Xcode**) and
      reopen.

      If Xcode doesn't update after you make a change, try clicking
      **File > Packages > Reset Package Caches**.
      :::

   1. If your `ios/plugin_name.podspec` file has [CocoaPods `dependency`][]s,
      add the corresponding [Swift Package Manager dependencies][] to your
      `Package.swift` file.

   1. If your package must be linked explicitly `static` or `dynamic`
      ([not recommended by Apple][]), update the [Product][] to define the
      type:

      ```swift title="Package.swift"
      products: [
          .library(name: "plugin-name", type: .static, targets: ["plugin_name"])
      ],
      ```

   1. Make any other customizations. For more information on how to write a
      `Package.swift` file, see
      [https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/packagedescription).

      :::tip
      If you add targets to your `Package.swift` file, use unique names.
      This avoids conflicts with targets from other packages.
      :::

1. Update your `ios/plugin_name.podspec` to point to new paths.

   ```ruby title="ios/plugin_name.podspec" diff
   - s.source_files = 'Classes/**/*.swift'
   - s.resource_bundles = {'plugin_name_privacy' => ['Resources/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy']}
   + s.source_files = 'plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/**/*.swift'
   + s.resource_bundles = {'plugin_name_privacy' => ['plugin_name/Sources/plugin_name/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy']}
   ```

1. Update loading of resources from bundle to use [`Bundle.module`][].

   ```swift
   #if SWIFT_PACKAGE
        let settingsURL = Bundle.module.url(forResource: "image", withExtension: "jpg")
   #else
        let settingsURL = Bundle(for: Self.self).url(forResource: "image", withExtension: "jpg")
   #endif
   ```

   :::note
   `Bundle.module` only works if there are resources
   [defined in the `Package.swift` file][Bundling resources] or
   [automatically included by Xcode][Xcode resource detection]).
   Otherwise, using `Bundle.module` results in an error.
   :::

1. Commit your plugin's changes to your version control system.

1. Verify the plugin still works with CocoaPods.

   1. Turn off Swift Package Manager.

      ```sh
      flutter config --no-enable-swift-package-manager
      ```

   1. Navigate to the plugin's example app.

      ```sh
      cd path/to/plugin/example/
      ```

   1. Ensure the plugin's example app builds and runs.

      ```sh
      flutter run
      ```

   1. Navigate to the plugin's top-level directory.

      ```sh
      cd path/to/plugin/
      ```

   1. Run CocoaPods validation lints.

      ```sh
      pod lib lint ios/plugin_name.podspec  --configuration=Debug --skip-tests --use-modular-headers --use-libraries
      ```

      ```sh
      pod lib lint ios/plugin_name.podspec  --configuration=Debug --skip-tests --use-modular-headers
      ```

1. Verify the plugin works with Swift Package Manager.

   1. Turn on Swift Package Manager.

       ```sh
       flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager
       ```

   1. Navigate to the plugin's example app.

      ```sh
      cd path/to/plugin/example/
      ```

   1. Ensure the plugin's example app builds and runs.

      ```sh
      flutter run
      ```

      :::note
      Using the Flutter CLI to run the plugin's example app with the
      Swift Package Manager feature turned on migrates the project to add
      Swift Package Manager integration.

      This raises the example app's Flutter SDK requirement to version 3.24 or
      higher.

      If you'd like to run the example app using an older Flutter SDK version,
      do not commit the migration's changes to your version control system.
      If needed, you can always
      [undo the Swift Package Manager migration][removeSPM].
      :::

   1. Open the plugin's example app in Xcode.
      Ensure that **Package Dependencies** shows in the left
      **Project Navigator**.

1. Verify tests pass.

   * **If your plugin has native unit tests (XCTest), make sure you also
     [update unit tests in the plugin's example app][].**

   * Follow instructions for [testing plugins][].
