### Text editor or integrated development environment

You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor or
integrated development environment (IDE) combined with
Flutter's command-line tools.

Using an IDE with a Flutter extension or plugin provides code completion,
syntax highlighting, widget editing assists, debugging, and other features.

Popular options include:

* [Visual Studio Code][] {{site.appmin.vscode}} or later
  with the [Flutter extension for VS Code][].
* [Android Studio][] {{site.appmin.android_studio}} or later
  with the [Flutter plugin for IntelliJ][].
* [IntelliJ IDEA][] {{site.appmin.intellij_idea}} or later
  with both the [Flutter plugin for IntelliJ][] and
  the [Android plugin for IntelliJ][].
