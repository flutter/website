## Software requirements

To write and compile Flutter code for {{v-target}},
install the following packages.

### Operating system

Flutter supports developing on macOS 12 (Monterey) or later.
This guide presumes your Mac runs the `zsh` as your [default shell][zsh-mac].

Some Flutter components require the
[Rosetta 2 translation process][need-rosetta].
If you're developing on an [Apple Silicon][] (ARM) Mac,
install [Rosetta 2][rosetta]:

```console
$ sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

### Development tools

Download and install the following packages.

{% case include.target %}
{% when 'desktop','iOS' %}

* [Xcode][] to debug and compile native Swift or Objective-C code.
  The Xcode installation also includes Git to manage Flutter versions
  and your own source code versioning.
* [CocoaPods][] to compile and enable Flutter plugins in your native apps.

{% when 'Android' %}

* [Android Studio][] to debug and compile Java or Kotlin code for Android.
  Flutter requires the full version of Android Studio.
* [Git][] to manage Flutter versions and your own source code versioning.
  To check if you have `git` installed,
  type `git version` in your Terminal.
  If you need to install `git`, run `xcode-select --install`.

{% when 'Web' -%}

* [Google Chrome][] to debug JavaScript code for web apps.
* [Git][] to manage Flutter versions and your own source code versioning.
  To check if you have `git` installed,
  type `git version` in your Terminal.
  If you need to install `git`, run `xcode-select --install`.

### Text editor or integrated development environment

You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor or
integrated development environment (IDE) combined with
Flutter's command-line tools.

Using an IDE with a Flutter extension or plugin provides code completion,
syntax highlighting, widget editing assists, debugging, and other features.

Popular options include:

* [Visual Studio Code][] with the [Flutter extension for VS Code][].
* [Android Studio][] with the [Flutter plugin for IntelliJ][].
* [IntelliJ IDEA][] with both
  the [Flutter plugin for IntelliJ][] and the [Android plugin for IntelliJ][].
