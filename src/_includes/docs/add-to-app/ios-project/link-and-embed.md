Flutter plugins might produce [static or dynamic frameworks][].
Link static frameworks, [_never_ embed them][static-framework].

If you embed a static framework into your iOS app,
you can't publish that app to the App Store.
Publishing fails with a
`Found an unexpected Mach-O header code` archive error.

##### Link all frameworks

To link the necessary frameworks, follow this procedure.

1. Choose the frameworks to link.

   1. In the **Project Navigator**, click on your project.

   1. Click the **Build Phases** tab.

   1. Expand **Link Binary With Libraries**.

      {% render docs/captioned-image.liquid,
      image:"development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/linked-libraries.png",
      caption:"Expand the **Link Binary With Libraries** build phase in Xcode" %}

   1. Click **+** (plus sign).

   1. Click **Add Other...** then **Add Files...**.

   1. From the **Choose frameworks and libraries to add:** dialog box,
      navigate to the `/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/Release/` directory.

   1. Command-click the frameworks in that directory then click **Open**.

      {% render docs/captioned-image.liquid,
      image:"development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/choose-libraries.png",
      caption:"Choose frameworks to link from the **Choose frameworks and
      libraries to add:** dialog box in Xcode" %}

1. Update the paths to the libraries to account for build modes.

   1. Launch the Finder.

   1. Navigate to the `/path/to/MyApp/` directory.

   1. Right-click on `MyApp.xcodeproj` and select **Show Package
      Contents**.

   1. Open `project.pbxproj` with Xcode. The file opens in Xcode's text
      editor. This also locks **Project Navigator** until you close the text editor.

      {% render docs/captioned-image.liquid,
      image:"development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/project-pbxproj.png",
      caption:"The `project-pbxproj` file open in the Xcode text editor" %}

   1. Find the lines that resemble the following text in the
      `/* Begin PBXFileReference section */`.

      ```text
      312885572C1A441C009F74FF /* Flutter.xcframework */ = {
        isa = PBXFileReference;
        expectedSignature = "AppleDeveloperProgram:S8QB4VV633:FLUTTER.IO LLC";
        lastKnownFileType = wrapper.xcframework;
        name = Flutter.xcframework;
        path = Flutter/[!Release!]/Flutter.xcframework;
        sourceTree = "<group>";
      };
      312885582C1A441C009F74FF /* App.xcframework */ = {
        isa = PBXFileReference;
        lastKnownFileType = wrapper.xcframework;
        name = App.xcframework;
        path = Flutter/[!Release!]/App.xcframework;
        sourceTree = "<group>";
      };
      ```

   1. Change the `Release` text highlighted in the prior step
      and change it to `$(CONFIGURATION)`. Also wrap the path in
      quotation marks.

      ```text
      312885572C1A441C009F74FF /* Flutter.xcframework */ = {
        isa = PBXFileReference;
        expectedSignature = "AppleDeveloperProgram:S8QB4VV633:FLUTTER.IO LLC";
        lastKnownFileType = wrapper.xcframework;
        name = Flutter.xcframework;
        path = [!"!]Flutter/[!$(CONFIGURATION)!]/Flutter.xcframework[!"!];
        sourceTree = "<group>";
      };
      312885582C1A441C009F74FF /* App.xcframework */ = {
        isa = PBXFileReference;
        lastKnownFileType = wrapper.xcframework;
        name = App.xcframework;
        path = [!"!]Flutter/[!$(CONFIGURATION)!]/App.xcframework[!"!];
        sourceTree = "<group>";
      };
      ```

1. Update the search paths.

   1. Click the **Build Settings** tab.

   1. Navigate to **Search Paths**

   1. Double-click to the right of **Framework Search Paths**.

   1. In the combo box, click **+** (plus sign).

   1. Type `$(inherited)`.
      and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

   1. Click **+** (plus sign).

   1. Type `$(PROJECT_DIR)/Flutter/$(CONFIGURATION)/`
      and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

      {% render docs/captioned-image.liquid, image:"development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/framework-search-paths.png", caption:"Update **Framework Search Paths** in Xcode" %}

After linking the frameworks, they should display in the
**Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**
section of your target's **General** settings.

##### Embed the dynamic frameworks

To embed your dynamic frameworks, complete the following procedure.

1. Navigate to **General** <span aria-label="and then">></span>
   **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.

1. Click on each of your dynamic frameworks and select **Embed & Sign**.

   {% render docs/captioned-image.liquid,
   image:"development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/choose-to-embed.png",
   caption:"Select **Embed & Sign** for each of your frameworks in Xcode" %}

   Don't include any static frameworks,
   including `FlutterPluginRegistrant.xcframework`.

1. Click the **Build Phases** tab.

1. Expand **Embed Frameworks**.
   Your dynamic frameworks should display in that section.

   {% render docs/captioned-image.liquid,
   image:"development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup/embed-xcode.png",
   caption:"The expanded **Embed Frameworks** build phase in Xcode" %}

1. Build the project.

   1. Open `MyApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

      Verify that you're opening `MyApp.xcworkspace` and
      not opening `MyApp.xcodeproj`.
      The `.xcworkspace` file has the CocoaPod dependencies,
      the `.xcodeproj` doesn't.

   1. Select **Product** <span aria-label="and then">></span>
      **Build** or press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>.

#### Set LLDB Init File

:::warning
Set your scheme to use Flutter's LLDB Init File. Without this file, debugging
on an iOS 26 or later device may crash.
:::

1. Generate Flutter LLDB files.

   1. Within your flutter application, re-run `flutter build ios-framework` if
      you haven't already:

   ```console
   $ flutter build ios-framework --output=/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/
   ```

   This will generate the LLDB files in the `/path/to/MyApp/Flutter/` directory.

1. Set the LLDB Init File.

   1. Go to **Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme**.

   1. Select the **Run** section in the left side bar.

   1. Set the **LLDB Init File** to the following:

      ```console
      $(PROJECT_DIR)/Flutter/flutter_lldbinit
      ```

      If your scheme already has an **LLDB Init File**, you can add Flutter's
      LLDB file to it. The path to Flutter's LLDB Init File must be relative
      to the location of your project's LLDB Init File.

      For example, if your LLDB file is located at `/path/to/MyApp/.lldbinit`,
      you would add the following:

      ```console
      command source --relative-to-command-file "Flutter/flutter_lldbinit"
      ```
