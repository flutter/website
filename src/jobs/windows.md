## About the team

Flutter is the most popular multi-platform UI toolkit, with shipped support for iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux. On Windows, we're allowing Flutter developers to target an additional 1B users, and we're offering a better alternative to desktop developers who use Electron, Windows Forms, WPF, or (shudder) UWP!

The Flutter Desktop Team is responsible for the desktop-specific (Windows, macOS, Linux) embeddings of the Flutter engine, which includes enabling platform plugins, nesting platform views inside Flutter apps, and wiring-up accessibility hooks on those platforms – and anything else that helps Flutter feel “native” when run in those environments.

## About the position

In the "Windows Engineer" role you'll be part of the team that makes Flutter apps the absolute best they can be when running on Windows, including:

*   Designing and building multi-window support.
*   Building support for Windows system menu integration.
*   Adding support for shell / window drag ‘n drop.
*   Adding support for nesting Windows UI views inside Flutter apps.
*   Delivering outstanding performance on Windows.
*   Nurturing a thriving community of contributions from open-source developers by reviewing GitHub issues and pull requests (PRs).
