title: Flutter Developer Relations Engineer
---

<p>
  Dart/Flutter DevRel grows and supports the Dart and Flutter developer
  communities. We onboard and retain new developers by building a fun, smart,
  and approachable culture, providing resources to help them succeed, and
  advocating on their behalf.
</p>

<p>A few of our projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning tools like the online code editor
    <a href="https://dartpad.dev">DartPad</a>.</li>
  <li>Learning resources like codelabs, guides, and sample applications.</li>
  <li>Outreach via channels like video, social media, and in-person events.</li>
  <li>Product excellence programs like Flutter Annoyances and Zeroth Customer.
  </li>
  <li>A worldwide community of meetups, GDGs, and other Flutter groups.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Most of the responsibilities for this role take forms common to DevRel across
  Google: write sample code, advocate for improvements to pain points, create
  scalable developer resources, and so on. Here are a few things, though, that
  make this gig unique:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>We have a fantastic developer community. They're energetic, silly, and
  welcoming. It's extremely important that we maintain that vibe, and you'll be
  directly responsible for doing so.</li>
  <li>Flutter's <a href="https://youtube.com/flutterdev">YouTube channel</a> is
  highly engaged, and you'll have the chance to contribute to its content and
  become one of Flutter's public faces.</li>
  <li>Flutter is built to power beautiful UI. If you have both coding chops and
  an eye for great design, you can put them to work on this team.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Job responsibilities</h2>

<p>As a member of the team, you'll definitely do these three things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make yourself into an expert in Dart and Flutter. They're both fun to use,
  so this is the best part.</li>
  <li>Build an inclusive, collaborative, and fun team culture.</li>
  <li>Bring that same culture to the wider Dart and Flutter communities. You'll
  welcome beginners, challenge experts, and advocate for under-served developer
  populations.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you'll do some or all of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Become one of Flutter's public faces, and contribute new content to one of
  Google's fastest growing YouTube channels and one of its most engaged social
  audiences.</li>
  <li>Engineer new features for DartPad and the Dart and Flutter websites.</li>
  <li>Design and build code samples for GitHub, DartPad, user studies, and live
  audiences.</li>
  <li>Write in-depth technical guides, examples, and codelabs.</li>
  <li>Earn the trust of the engineering and product teams, and use it to
  champion the needs of Flutter developers.</li>
  <li>Appear where Flutter developers come together, teach them, answer their
  questions, and listen to them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Job locations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mountain View, CA
  <li>Seattle, WA
</ul>

<h2>Minimum qualifications</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Authorization to work in the United States (US citizenship or work

  Node.js, Go, iOS, Android mobile app developerment, and/or web tech.</li>
  <li>Experience in a technical consulting or customer facing capacity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preferred qualifications:</h2>

<p><i>Having these qualifications is a plus, but transferable
