New to the [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org) language?
We compiled our favorite resources to
help you quickly learn Dart.
We looked at a lot of languages, and
[we found Dart easy and fun to learn](/resources/faq/#why-did-flutter-choose-to-use-dart).
We hope these resources make Dart
easy for you to learn, too.

[Language tour](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/language-tour)
: Your best introduction to the Dart language. Learn about Dart's
  features such as _optional types_, _closures_, _libraries_, _lexical scoping_,
  _top-level functions_, _named parameters_, _async / await_, and lots more.

[Library tour](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/libraries/library-tour)
: A good overview of Dart's powerful core libraries. Learn about
  Dart's support for collections, async, math, numbers, strings, JSON, and more.

[Intro to Dart for Java Developers Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/from-java-to-dart)
: Use your Java knowledge to get up and running quickly with Dart. Learn about
  classes, constructors, parameters, and interfaces with examples from the Java
  Tutorial.

[Effective Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/effective-dart)
: Guides for style, authoring documentation, usage, and more.

[Asynchronous Programming: Futures Tutorial](https://www.dartlang.org/tutorials/language/futures)
: Learn how to use Futures, which are used extensively in the Dart core
  libraries.  Futures can be used instead of one-time callbacks.

[Asynchronous Programming: Streams Tutorial](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/streams/)
: Learn how to use Streams, which are used extensively in the Dart core
  libraries. Streams can be used instead repeating callbacks.
  For example, the
  [File class](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/dart-io/File-class.html)
  uses Streams to read bytes from a file.
