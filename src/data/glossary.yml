- term: "Impeller"
  short_description: |-
    Flutter's modern graphics rendering engine,
    designed for smooth, predictable performance.
  long_description: |-
    _Impeller_ is Flutter's high-performance rendering engine,
    built from the ground up for Flutter's needs and modern graphics APIs.

    Its primary goal is to provide consistently smooth performance and
    eliminate stuttering while rendering, particularly that
    caused by shader compilation during animations and interactions.

    Impeller achieves this by pre-compiling a specific, smaller set of
    shaders at application build time, rather than compiling at runtime.

- term: "Widget"
  short_description: |-
    The basic building block of a Flutter user interface.
  long_description: |-
    An immutable description of part of a user interface.

    In Flutter, almost everything is a _widget_.
    Widgets are the fundamental building blocks you use to
    create your application's UI with Flutter.
    Each widget is an immutable declaration of _what the UI should
    look like based on its current configuration and state.

    Widgets are composed together in a hierarchy to form the widget tree.
    When a widget's state changes, the Flutter framework
    rebuilds the necessary parts of the tree to update the UI.
    
    There are two primary types of widgets,
    including [`StatelessWidget`][], which have no mutable state, and
    [`StatefulWidget`][], which have a persistent [state][] that can be updated.

    [`StatelessWidget`]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html
    [`StatefulWidget`]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html
    [state]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html
