- term: "Hot reload"
  short_description: |-
    A Flutter feature (also called "stateful hot reload")
    that allows you to inject updated code into 
    a running application in the Dart VM and see the changes immediately
    while maintaining application state.
  long_description: |-
    This feature is also called "stateful hot reload".
    After the Dart runtime updates classes with the new versions
    of fields and functions, the Flutter framework automatically
    rebuilds the widget tree, allowing you to quickly view the effects
    of your changes. Hot reload greatly increases the speed of development.

    Hot reload works on mobile, web, and desktop apps that are
    running in debug mode and is fully supported in VS Code,
    Android Studio, and IntelliJ IDEA. It does not re-run `main` or
    `initState`; for that, use [hot restart][].

- term: "Hot restart"
  short_description: |-
    Similar to hot reload, but it does not maintain app state.
    Use hot restart to re-run `main` or `initState`.
  long_description: |-
    Hot restart is still faster than a full restart, which also
    recompiles the native, platform code (such as Swift).
    On the web, it also restarts the Dart Development Compiler (DDC).

- term: "Impeller"
  short_description: |-
    Flutter's modern graphics rendering engine,
    designed for smooth, predictable performance.
  long_description: |-
    _Impeller_ is Flutter's high-performance rendering engine,
    built from the ground up for Flutter's needs and modern graphics APIs.

    Its primary goal is to provide consistently smooth performance and
    eliminate stuttering while rendering, particularly that
    caused by shader compilation during animations and interactions.

    Impeller achieves this by pre-compiling a specific, smaller set of
    shaders at application build time, rather than compiling at runtime.

- term: "Sliver"
  short_description: |-
    A customizable portion of a scrollable area.
  long_description: |-
    A sliver is a portion of a scrollable area that you can define
    to behave in a special way.
    Think of slivers as building blocks that you can compose together
    inside a `CustomScrollView` to create custom scrolling experiences,
    like elastic scrolling or a collapsing header.
    Slivers are built lazily, which means that Flutter only renders
    the slivers that are visible on screen,
    making them very efficient for long lists of content.

- term: "Widget"
  short_description: |-
    The basic building block of a Flutter user interface.
  long_description: |-
    An immutable description of part of a user interface.

    In Flutter, almost everything is a _widget_.
    Widgets are the fundamental building blocks you use to
    create your application's UI with Flutter.
    Each widget is an immutable declaration of _what the UI should
    look like based on its current configuration and state.

    Widgets are composed together in a hierarchy to form the widget tree.
    When a widget's state changes, the Flutter framework
    rebuilds the necessary parts of the tree to update the UI.
    
    There are two primary types of widgets,
    including [`StatelessWidget`][], which have no mutable state, and
    [`StatefulWidget`][], which have a persistent [state][] that can be updated.

    [`StatelessWidget`]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html
    [`StatefulWidget`]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html
    [state]: https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State-class.html
