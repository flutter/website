title: Implicit animations
description: Where to find more information on using implicit animations in Flutter.
---

With Flutter's [animation library][],
you can add motion and create visual effects
for the widgets in your UI.
One part of the library is an assortment of widgets
that manage animations for you.
These widgets are collectively referred to as _implicit animations_,
or _implicitly animated widgets_, deriving their name from the
[`ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget`][] class that they implement.
The following set of resources provide many ways to learn
about implicit animations in Flutter.
