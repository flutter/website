## Web setup

{{site.alert.warning}}
Note: As of 1.12, Flutter has early support for running web applications, but you need to be running the beta channel of
Flutter at present. If you experience a problem that hasn’t yet been reported, please [file an issue][] and make sure that
“web” appears in the title.
{{site.alert.end}}

To prepare to run and test your Flutter app on the web,
you must [install Chrome][], if you haven't already.
