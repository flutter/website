## **February 26, 2019**

Flutter released [version
1.2](https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/02/launching-flutter-12-at-mobile-world.html)
at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona. For more information,
see the [release
notes](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Release-Notes---Flutter-1.2.1)
or [download the release](/docs/development/tools/sdk/archive).

In addition, here are some recent new docs:

* We've updated our [state management
  advice](/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/intro).
  New pages include an
  [introduction](/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/intro),
  [thinking
  declaratively](/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/declarative),
  [ephemeral vs app
  state](/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/ephemeral-vs-app),
  [simple app state
  management](/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple),
  and [different state management
  options](/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options).
  Documenting state management is a tricky thing, as there is no
  one-size-fits-all approach. We'd love your feedback on these new docs!
* A new page on [Performance best practices](/docs/testing/best-practices).
* Also at MWC, we announced a preview version of the new Dart DevTools
  for profiling and debugging Dart and Flutter apps.
  You can find the docs on the
  [DevTools wiki](https://flutter.github.io/devtools/).
  In particular, check out the DevTool's [Flutter widget
  inspector](https://flutter.github.io/devtools/inspector) for debugging
  your UI, or the [timeline
  view](https://flutter.github.io/devtools/timeline) for profiling your Flutter
  application. Try them out and let us know what you think!
* An update to the [Performance profiling](/docs/testing/ui-performance)
  page that incorporates the new Dart DevTools UI.
* Updates to the [Android
  Studio/IntelliJ](/docs/development/tools/android-studio)
  and [VS Code](/docs/development/tools/vs-code) pages incorporating info from
  the new Dart DevTools UI.

If you have questions or comments about any of these docs, [file an
issue]({{site.repo.this}}/issues).
