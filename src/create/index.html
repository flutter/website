        <h4>Submission guidelines:</h4>
        <div class="create__text-columns">
            <p>Your application must be submitted in the form of a ZIP file
               containing everything needed to run it on a target Android or
               iOS device.</p>
            <p>You should include a <code>README.md</code> file that includes a
               brief description of the application and any special instructions
               for running it (for example, if the application is designed for a
               specific platform target).</p>
            <p>Code should be licensed with an open source license (we recommend
               BSD, MIT or Apache), so that we can judge it and others can
               benefit from your work.</p>
            <p>We will run the application by unpacking the ZIP file and running
               the command <code>flutter run --release</code> to execute it
               on an attached Android or iOS device.</p>
            <p>The ZIP file may contain other files and directories that are
               created using the flutter create command, such as
               <code>pubspec.yaml</code>; it may also include asset files
               (e.g. images, fonts) or data. We recommend running
               <code>flutter clean</code> before creating the ZIP file to
               strip out unnecessary binaries.</p>
            <p>With the exception of packages (see below), all executable content
               must be included in the ZIP file.</p>
            <p>All code needed to load and execute the application must be
               written in Dart, with the exception of any packages
               (as mentioned below).</p>
            <p>Dart code must appear in a file that has a filename ending in
               <code>.dart</code>. The total size of all Dart files in the ZIP
               file, excluding unit tests that are not executed, must be no
               more than 5,120 bytes as (for example) measured by the
               command <code>find . -name "*.dart" | xargs cat | wc -c.</code></p>
            <p>The application may use Flutter packages that are a) published
               on <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org">pub.dartlang.org</a>;
               b) have broad applicability (e.g. not written solely for the
               purpose of circumventing the 5KB file limit, in the opinion
               of the judges).</p>
