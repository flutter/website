Flutter is a new project to help developers
build high-performance, high-fidelity,
mobile apps for iOS and Android
from a single codebase.

_Flutter is an early-stage open-source project._
We are still missing core features like accessibility, text input,
localization, and more. However, you can build demos and examples
today. We hope you try it out and send us
[feedback](mailto:flutter-dev@googlegroups.com).

## Getting started

First, [set up your machine](/setup/)
with Flutter and iOS/Android tools.
Then, check out our
[Getting Started guide](getting-started)
