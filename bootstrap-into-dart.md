New to the [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org) language?
We compiled our favorite resources to
help you quickly learn Dart.
We looked at a lot of languages, and
[we found Dart easy and fun to learn](/faq/#why-did-flutter-choose-to-use-dart).
We hope these resources make Dart
easy for you to learn, too.

[Language tour](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html)
: Your best introduction to the Dart language. Learn about Dart's
  features such as _optional types_, _closures_, _libraries_, _lexical scoping_,
  _top-level functions_, _named parameters_, _async / await_, and lots more.

[Library tour](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch03.html)
: A good overview of Dart's powerful core libraries. Learn about
  Dart's support for collections, async, math, numbers, strings, JSON, and more.

[Effective Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/effective-dart/)
: Guides for style, authoring documentation, usage, and more.

[Futures Tutorial](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/futures/)
: Learn how to use Futures, which are used extensively in the Dart core
  libraries.  Futures can be used instead of one-time callbacks.

[Streams Tutorial](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/streams/)
: Learn how to use Streams, which are used extensively in the Dart core
  libraries. Streams can be used instead repeating callbacks.
  For example, the
  [File class](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/dart.io/File-class.html)
  uses Streams to read bytes from a file.
