# adaptive_app_demos

This project contains demo code for adaptive app development techniques from https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter-adaptive-demo. 

Additional example code in this project was moved from code snippets originally seen in [Building adaptive apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout/building-adaptive-apps) to ensure analysis in the flutter.dev CI pipeline. These snippets were intended to illustrate concepts and may therefore not be fully integrated/a functional part of the original demo code.
