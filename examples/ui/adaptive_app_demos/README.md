# adaptive_app_demos

This project contains demo code for adaptive app development techniques from
https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter-adaptive-demo.

Additional example code in this project was moved from
code snippets originally seen in
[Building adaptive apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/responsive/building-adaptive-apps)
to ensure analysis in the flutter.dev CI pipeline.
These snippets were intended to illustrate concepts and may
therefore not be fully integrated/a functional part of the original demo code.
